<a name='INTRODUCTION'></a><a name='Page_-1'></a><a name='Page_-2'></a><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The primary aim of this book is to give as much information
about English authors, including under this designation American
and Colonial writers, as the prescribed limits will admit of.
At the same time an attempt has been made, where materials
exist for it, to enhance the interest by introducing such details
as tend to illustrate the characters and circumstances of the respective
writers and the manner in which they passed through
the world; and in the case of the more important, to give some
indication of the relative place which they hold and the leading
features of their work.</p>

<p>Including the Appendix of Living Writers, the work contains
upwards of 1600 names; but large as this number is, the number
of those who have contributed something of interest and value
to the vast store of English Literature is larger still, and any
attempt to make a book of this kind absolutely exhaustive
would be futile.</p>

<p>The word &quot;literature&quot; is here used in a very wide sense,
and this gives rise to considerable difficulty in drawing the line
of exclusion. There are very many writers whose claim to
admission may reasonably be considered as good as that of
some who have been included; but even had it been possible
to discover all these, their inclusion would have swelled the
work beyond its limits. A line had to be drawn somewhere,
and the writer has used his best judgment in making that line
as consistent as possible. It may probably, however, be safely
claimed that every department of the subject of any importance
is well represented.</p>

<p>Wherever practicable (and this includes all but a very few
articles), various authorities have been collated, and pains have
been taken to secure accuracy; but where so large a collection
of facts and dates is involved, it would be too sanguine to
expect that success has invariably been attained.</p>

<a name='ABBOTT_JACOB_1803_1879'></a><a name='Page_1'></a><p><b>ABBOTT, JACOB (1803-1879).</b>
&mdash;Educationalist and miscellaneous
author, <i>b.</i> at Hallowell, Maine, <i>ed.</i> at Bowdoin Coll. and
Andover, entered the ministry of the Congregational Church, but
was best known as an educationist and writer of religious and other
books, mainly for the young. Among them are <i>Beechnut Tales</i> and
<i>The Rollo Books</i>, both of which still have a very wide circulation.</p><br />

<a name='ABBOTT_JOHN_STEVENS_CABOT_1805_1877'></a><p><b>ABBOTT, JOHN STEVENS CABOT (1805-1877).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
etc., <i>b.</i> Brunswick, Maine, and <i>ed.</i> at Bowdoin Coll. He studied
theology and became a minister of the Congregational Church at
various places in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Owing to the
success of a little work, <i>The Mother at Home</i>, he devoted himself,
from 1844 onwards, to literature, and especially to historical writing.
Among his principal works, which were very popular, are: <i>History of
Napoleon Bonaparte</i> (1852-55), <i>History of the Civil War in America</i>
(1863-66), and <i>History of Frederick the Great</i> (1871).</p><br />

<a name='A_BECKETT_GILBERT_ABBOTT_1811_1856'></a><p><b>&Agrave; BECKETT, GILBERT ABBOTT (1811-1856).</b>
&mdash;Comic
writer, <i>b.</i> in London, the <i>s.</i> of a lawyer, and belonged to a family
claiming descent from Thomas &agrave; Becket. Destined for the legal
profession, he was called to the Bar. In addition to contributions
to various periodicals and newspapers, including <i>Punch</i>, <i>The Illustrated
London News</i>, <i>The Times</i>, and <i>Morning Herald</i>, he produced
over fifty plays, many of which attained great popularity, and he also
helped to dramatise some of Dickens' works. He is perhaps best
known as the author of <i>Comic History of England</i>, <i>Comic History
of Rome</i>, <i>Comic Blackstone</i>, etc. He was also distinguished in his
profession, acted as a commissioner on various important matters,
and was appointed a metropolitan police magistrate.</p><br />

<a name='ABERCROMBIE_JOHN_1780_1844'></a><p><b>ABERCROMBIE, JOHN (1780-1844).</b>
&mdash;Physician and writer
on mental science, <i>s.</i> of a minister, was <i>b.</i> at Aberdeen, and <i>ed.</i> at
the Grammar School and Marischal College there. He studied
medicine at Edinburgh, in which city he practised as a physician.
He made valuable contributions to the literature of his profession,
and <i>pub.</i> two works, <i>Enquiry Concerning the Intellectual Powers</i>
(1830) and <i>The Philosophy of the Moral Feelings</i> (1833), which,
though popular at the time of their publication, have long been
superseded. For his services as a physician and philanthropist
he received many marks of distinction, including the Rectorship of
Marischal College<a name='Page_2'></a>.</p><br />

<a name='ABERCROMBIE_PATRICK_1656_1716'></a><p><b>ABERCROMBIE, PATRICK (1656-1716).</b>
&mdash;Antiquary and
historian, was physician to James II. in 1685; he was a Jacobite
and opposed the Union in various pamphlets. His chief work was
<i>Martial Achievements of the Scots Nation</i> (1711-16).</p><br />

<a name='ACTON_JOHN_EMERICH_EDWARD_DALBERG_ACTON_1ST_LORD_1834_1902'></a><p><b>ACTON, JOHN EMERICH EDWARD DALBERG-ACTON, 1ST LORD (1834-1902).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
<i>s.</i> of Sir Richard A., and grandson
of Sir John A., who was Prime Minister of Naples, was <i>b.</i> at Naples.
He belonged to an ancient Roman Catholic family, and was <i>ed.</i> first
at Oscott near Birmingham under Dr. (afterwards Card.) Wiseman.
Thence he went to Edinburgh, where he studied privately,
and afterwards to Munich, where he resided in the house of Dr.
Dollinger, the great scholar and subsequent leader of the Old
Catholic party, by whom he was profoundly influenced. While at
Edinburgh he endeavoured to procure admission to Cambridge, but
without success, his religion being at that time a bar. He early
devoted himself to the study of history, and is said to have been on
terms of intimacy with every contemporary historian of distinction,
with the exception of Guizot. He sat in the House of Commons
1859-65, but made no great mark, and in 1869 was raised to the
peerage as Lord Acton of Aldenham. For a time he edited <i>The
Rambler</i>, a Roman Catholic periodical, which afterwards became
the <i>Home and Foreign Review</i>, and which, under his care, became
one of the most learned publications of the day. The liberal
character of A.'s views, however, led to its stoppage in deference to
the authorities of the Church. He, however, maintained a lifelong
opposition to the Ultramontane party in the Church, and in 1874
controverted their position in four letters to <i>The Times</i> which were
described as the most crushing argument against them which ever
appeared in so condensed a form. A.'s contributions to literature
were few, and, in comparison with his extraordinary learning,
comparatively unimportant. He wrote upon <i>Cardinal Wolsey</i>
(1877) and <i>German Schools of History</i> (1886). He was extremely
modest, and the loftiness of his ideals of accuracy and completeness
of treatment led him to shrink from tasks which men of far slighter
equipment might have carried out with success. His learning and
his position as a universally acknowledged master in his subject
were recognised by his appointment in 1895 as Professor of Modern
History at Cambridge. Perhaps his most valuable services to
historical literature were his laying down the lines of the great
<i>Cambridge Modern History</i>, and his collection of a library of 60,000
vols., which after his death was purchased by an American millionaire
and presented to Lord Morley of Blackburn, who placed it in
the University of Cambridge.</p><br />

<a name='ADAMNAN_ST_625_704'></a><p><b>ADAMNAN, ST. (625?-704).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>b.</i> in Donegal,
became Abbot of Iona in 679. Like other Irish churchmen he was
a statesman as well as an ecclesiastic, and appears to have been sent
on various political missions. In the great controversy on the
subject of the holding of Easter, he sided with Rome against the
Irish Church. He left the earliest account we have of the state of
Palestine in the early ages of the Church; but of even more value is
his <i>Vita Sancti Columb&aelig;</i>, giving a minute account of the condition
and discipline of the church of Iona. He <i>d.</i> 704<a name='Page_3'></a>.</p><br />

<a name='ADAMS_FRANCIS_WL_1862_1893'></a><p><b>ADAMS, FRANCIS, W.L. (1862-1893).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, was <i>b.</i>
at Malta, and <i>ed.</i> at schools at Shrewsbury and in Paris. In 1882
he went to Australia, and was on the staff of <i>The Sydney Bulletin</i>.
In 1884 he <i>publ.</i> his autobiographical novel, <i>Leicester</i>, and in 1888
<i>Songs of the Army of the Night</i>, which created a sensation in Sydney.
His remaining important work is <i>Tiberius</i> (1894), a striking drama in
which a new view of the character of the Emperor is presented. He
<i>d.</i> by his own hand at Alexandria in a fit of depression caused by
hopeless illness.</p><br />

<a name='ADDISON_JOSEPH_1672_1719'></a><p><b>ADDISON, JOSEPH (1672-1719).</b>
&mdash;Poet, essayist and
statesman, was the <i>s.</i> of Lancelot Addison, Dean of Lichfield. <i>B.</i>
near Amesbury, Wilts., A. went to the Charterhouse where he made
the acquaintance of <a href='#STEELE_SIR_RICHARD_1672_1729'>Steele</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and then at the age of fifteen to
Oxford where he had a distinguished career, being specially noted
for his Latin verse. Intended at first for the Church, various circumstances
combined to lead him towards literature and politics.
His first attempts in English verse took the form of complimentary
addresses, and were so successful as to obtain for him the friendship
and interest of Dryden, and of Lord Somers, by whose means he
received, in 1699, a pension of &pound;300 to enable him to travel on the
continent with a view to diplomatic employment. He visited Italy,
whence he addressed his <i>Epistle</i> to his friend Halifax. Hearing of
the death of William III., an event which lost him his pension, he
returned to England in the end of 1703. For a short time his circumstances
were somewhat straitened, but the battle of Blenheim
in 1704 gave him a fresh opportunity of distinguishing himself.
The government wished the event commemorated by a poem; A.
was commissioned to write this, and produced <i>The Campaign</i>,
which gave such satisfaction that he was forthwith appointed a
Commissioner of Appeals. His next literary venture was an account
of his travels in Italy, which was followed by the opera of <i>Rosamund</i>.
In 1705, the Whigs having obtained the ascendency, A. was
made Under-Secretary of State and accompanied Halifax on a
mission to Hanover, and in 1708 was appointed Chief Secretary for
Ireland and Keeper of the Records of that country. It was at this
period that A. found his true vocation and laid the foundations of
his real fame. In 1709 Steele began to bring out the <i>Tatler</i>, to
which A. became almost immediately a contributor: thereafter he
(with Steele) started the <i>Spectator</i>, the first number of which appeared
on March 1, 1711. This paper, which at first appeared
daily, was kept up (with a break of about a year and a half when
the <i>Guardian</i> took its place) until Dec. 20, 1714. In 1713 the
drama of <i>Cato</i> appeared, and was received with acclamation by
both Whigs and Tories, and was followed by the comedy of the
<i>Drummer</i>. His last undertaking was <i>The Freeholder</i>, a party paper
(1715-16). The later events in the life of A., viz., his marriage in
1716 to the Dowager Countess of Warwick, to whose son he had
been tutor and his promotion to be Secretary of State did not contribute
to his happiness. His wife appears to have been arrogant
and imperious; his step-son the Earl was a rake and unfriendly to
him; while in his public capacity his invincible shyness made him
of little use in Parliament. He resigned his office in 1718, and, after
<a name='Page_4'></a>a period of ill-health, <i>d.</i> at Holland House, June 17, 1719, in
his 48th year. Besides the works above mentioned, he wrote
a <i>Dialogue on Medals</i>, and left unfinished a work on the Evidences
of Christianity. The character of A., if somewhat cool and unimpassioned,
was pure, magnanimous, and kind. The charm of his
manners and conversation made him one of the most popular and
admired men of his day; and while he laid his friends under obligations
for substantial favours, he showed the greatest forbearance
towards his few enemies. His style in his essays is remarkable for
its ease, clearness, and grace, and for an inimitable and sunny humour
which never soils and never hurts. The motive power of these
writings has been called &quot;an enthusiasm for conduct.&quot; Their
effect was to raise the whole standard of manners and expression
both in life and in literature. The only flaw in his character was a
tendency to convivial excess, which must be judged in view of the
laxer manners of his time. When allowance has been made for
this, he remains one of the most admirable characters and writers
in English literature.</p>

<a name='ADOLPHUS_JOHN_1768_1845'></a><p><b>ADOLPHUS, JOHN (1768-1845).</b>
&mdash;Historian, studied law
and was called to the Bar in 1807. He wrote <i>Biographical Memoirs
of the French Revolution</i> (1799) and <i>History of England from</i> 1760-1783
(1802), and other historical and biographical works.</p><br />

<a name='AELFRED_849_901'></a><p><b>&AElig;LFRED (849-901).</b>
&mdash;King of the West Saxons, and writer
and translator, <i>s.</i> of Ethelwulf, <i>b.</i> at Wantage. Besides being the
deliverer of his country from the ravages of the Danes, and the
restorer of order and civil government, <i>&AElig;.</i> has earned the title of
the father of English prose writing. The earlier part of his life was
filled with war and action, most of the details regarding which are
more or less legendary. But no sooner had he become King of
Wessex, in 871, than he began to prepare for the work of re-introducing
learning into his country. Gathering round him the few
scholars whom the Danes had left, and sending for others from
abroad, he endeavoured to form a literary class. His chief helper
in his great enterprise was Asser of St. David's, who taught him
Latin, and became his biographer in a &quot;life&quot; which remains the
best original authority for the period. Though not a literary artist,
&AElig;. had the best qualities of the scholar, including an insatiable
love alike for the acquisition and the communication of knowledge.
He translated several of the best books then existing, not, however,
<a name='Page_5'></a>in a slavish fashion, but editing and adding from his own stores.
In all his work his main desire was the good of his people. Among
the books he translated or edited were (1) <i>The Handbook</i>, a collection
of extracts on religious subjects; (2) <i>The Cura Pastoralis</i>, or
Herdsman's book of Gregory the Great, with a preface by himself
which is the first English prose; (3) <i>Bede's Ecclesiastical History of
the English</i>; (4) <i>The English Chronicle</i>, which, already brought up
to 855, he continued up to the date of writing; it is probably by his
own hand; (5) Orosius's <i>History of the World</i>, which he adapted for
English readers with many historical and geographical additions;
(6) the <i>De Consolatione Philosophi&aelig;</i> of Boethius; and (7) a translation
of some of the Psalms. He also made a collection of the best
laws of his predecessors, Ethelbert, Ine, and Offa. It has been said
&quot;although King Alfred lived a thousand years ago, a thousand years
hence, if there be England then, his memory will yet be precious to
his country.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='AELFRIC_955_c_1022'></a><p><b>&AElig;LFRIC (955-<i>c.</i> 1022).</b>
&mdash;Called Grammaticus (10th century),
sometimes confounded with two other persons of the same
name, &AElig;. of Canterbury and &AElig;. of York, was a monk at Winchester,
and afterwards Abbot of Cerne and Eynsham successively. He has
left works which shed an important light on the doctrine and
practice of the early Church in England, including two books of
homilies (990-94), a <i>Grammar</i>, <i>Glossary</i>, <i>Passiones Sanctorum</i>
(Sufferings of the Saints), translations of parts of the Bible with
omissions and interpolations, <i>Canones &AElig;lfrici</i>, and other theological
treatises. His writings had an influence on the formation of English
prose. He filled in his age somewhat the same position that Bede
did in his, that of a compiler and populariser of existing knowledge.</p><br />

<a name='AGUILAR_GRACE_1816_1847'></a><p><b>AGUILAR, GRACE (1816-1847).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and writer on
Jewish history and religion, was <i>b.</i> at Hackney of Jewish parents of
Spanish descent. She was delicate from childhood, and early
showed great interest in history, especially Jewish. The death of
her <i>f.</i> threw her on her own resources. After a few dramas and
poems she <i>pub.</i> in America in 1842 <i>Spirit of Judaism</i>, and in 1845
<i>The Jewish Faith</i> and <i>The Women of Israel</i>. She is, however, best
known by her novels, of which the chief are <i>Home Influence</i> (1847)
and <i>A Mother's Recompense</i> (1850). Her health gave way in 1847,
and she <i>d.</i> in that year at Frankfort.</p><br />

<a name='AIKIN_JOHN_1747_1822'></a><p><b>AIKIN, JOHN (1747-1822).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous writer, <i>s.</i> of Dr.
John A., Unitarian divine, <i>b.</i> at Kibworth, studied medicine at
Edinburgh and London, and received degree of M.D. at Leyden.
He began practice at Yarmouth but, one of his pamphlets having
given offence, he removed to London, where he obtained some
success in his profession, devoting all his leisure to literature, to
which his contributions were incessant. These consisted of
pamphlets, translations, and miscellaneous works, some in conjunction
with his sister, Mrs. Barbauld. Among his chief works are

&mdash;Historical and miscellaneous
writer, <i>dau.</i> of above and niece of <a href='#BARBAULD_ANNA_LETITIA_1743_1825'>Mrs. Barbauld</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). After<a name='Page_6'></a>
<i>pub.</i> a poem, <i>Epistles on Women</i>, and a novel, <i>Lorimer</i>, she began
the historical works on which her reputation chiefly rests, viz.,
<i>Memoirs of the Courts of Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I.</i> (1818-33)
and a <i>Life of Addison</i>. She also wrote lives of her father and
of Mrs. Barbauld. She was remarkable for her conversational
powers, and was also an admirable letter-writer. Like the rest of
her family she was a Unitarian.</p><br />

&mdash;Biographer and critic, <i>s.</i>
of an architect in London, <i>grad.</i> at Cambridge, entered the Church,
and, after holding various minor preferments, became Master of the
Temple. He wrote memoirs of Hood and Crabbe, but is best
known for his biography of Lamb and his edition of his works in 6
vols. (1883-88).</p><br />

<a name='AINSWORTH_WILLIAM_HARRISON_1805_1882'></a><p><b>AINSWORTH, WILLIAM HARRISON (1805-1882).</b>
&mdash;Novelist,
<i>s.</i> of a solicitor, was <i>b.</i> in Manchester. He was destined for the
legal profession, which, however, had no attraction for him; and
going to London to complete his studies made the acquaintance of
Mr. John Ebers, publisher, and at that time manager of the Opera
House, by whom he was introduced to literary and dramatic circles,
and whose <i>dau.</i> he afterwards married. For a short time he tried
the publishing business, but soon gave it up and devoted himself to
journalism and literature. His first successful novel was <i>Rookwood</i>,
<i>pub.</i> in 1834, of which Dick Turpin is the leading character, and
thenceforward he continued to pour forth till 1881 a stream of
novels, to the number of 39, of which the best known are <i>The Tower
of London</i> (1840), <i>Old St. Paul's</i> (1841), <i>Lancashire Witches</i>, and <i>The
Constable of the Tower</i>. The titles of some of his other novels are
<i>Crichton</i> (1837), <i>Jack Sheppard</i> (1839), <i>Guy Fawkes</i>, <i>The Star
Chamber</i>, <i>The Flitch of Bacon</i>, <i>The Miser's Daughter</i> (1842), and
<i>Windsor Castle</i> (1843). A. depends for his effects on striking situations
and powerful descriptions: he has little humour or power of
delineating character.</p><br />

<a name='AIRD_THOMAS_1802_1876'></a><p><b>AIRD, THOMAS (1802-1876).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Bowden, Roxburghshire,
went to Edinburgh, where he became the friend of Professor
Wilson, Carlyle, and other men of letters. He contributed to
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, and was editor of the <i>Dumfries Herald</i> (1835-63).
His chief poem is <i>The Captive of Fez</i> (1830); and in prose he
wrote <i>Religious Characteristics</i>, and <i>The Old Bachelor in the Old
Scottish Village</i> (1848), all of which were received with favour.
Carlyle said that in his poetry he found everywhere &quot;a healthy
breath as of mountain breezes.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='AKENSIDE_MARK_1721_1770'></a><p><b>AKENSIDE, MARK (1721-1770).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a butcher at
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, gave early indications of talent, and was sent
to the University of Edinburgh with the view of becoming a dissenting
minister. While there, however, he changed his mind and
studied for the medical profession. Thereafter he went to Leyden,
where he took his degree of M.D. in 1744. While there he wrote his
principal poem, <i>The Pleasures of the Imagination</i>, which was well
received, and was subsequently translated into more than one
foreign language. After trying Northampton, he settled as a
physician in London; but was for long largely dependent for his
<a name='Page_7'></a>livelihood on a Mr. Dyson. His talents brought him a good deal
of consideration in society, but the solemn and pompous manner
which he affected laid him open to some ridicule, and he is said to
have been satirised by <a href='#SMOLLETT_TOBIAS_GEORGE_1721_1771'>Smollett</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) in his <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>. He
endeavoured to reconstruct his poem, but the result was a failure.
His collected poems were <i>pub.</i> 1772. His works, however, are now
little read. Mr. Gosse has described him as &quot;a sort of frozen Keats.&quot;</p><br />

theorist, lecturer, and author, was <i>b.</i> in Pennsylvania. During the
American civil war she served as a nurse, and afterwards attained
celebrity as a writer of books for young people, of which the best is
<i>Little Women</i> (1868). Others are <i>Little Men</i> and <i>Jo's Boys</i>. She
also wrote novels, including <i>Moods</i> and <i>Work</i>.</p><br />

verse, his subjects embracing educational, theological, and historical
matters. Returning from Rome, to which he had been sent to
procure the <i>pallium</i> for a friend, he met Charlemagne at Parma, and
made upon him so favourable an impression that he was asked to
enter his service as preceptor in the sciences to himself and his
family. His numerous treatises, which include metrical annals,
hagiographical and philosophical works, are not distinguished by
originality or profundity, but he is the best representative of the
culture and mental activity of his age, upon which, as the minister
of education of the great emperor, he had a widely-spread influence.</p><br />

and then engaged in journalism. His first book was <i>The Bells, a
Collection of Chimes</i> (1855), and other poetical works are <i>The Ballad
of Babie Bell</i>, <i>Cloth of Gold</i>, <i>Flower and Thorn</i>, etc. In prose he
wrote <i>Daisy's Necklace</i>, <i>The Course of True Love</i>, <i>Marjorie Daw</i>,

<a name='ALESIUS_ALEXANDER_1500_1565'></a><p><b>ALESIUS, ALEXANDER (1500-1565).</b>
&mdash;Theologian and controversialist.
His unlatinised name was Aless or Alane, and he was
<i>b.</i> at Edinburgh and <i>ed.</i> at St. Andrews, where he became a canon.
Originally a strong and able defender of the Romish doctrines, he
was chosen to argue with Patrick Hamilton, the proto-martyr of the
Reformation in Scotland, with the object of inducing him to recant.
The result, however, was that he was himself much shaken in his
allegiance to the Church, and the change was greatly accelerated by
the martyrdom of H. His subsequent protest against the immorality
of the clergy led to his imprisonment, and ultimately, in 1532, to his
flying for his life to Germany, where he became associated with
Luther and Melancthon, and definitely joined the reforming party.
Coming to England in 1535, he was well received by Cranmer and
other reformers. While in England he studied medicine, and
practised as a physician in London. On the fall of T. Cromwell in
1540 he again retired to Germany, where, at Leipzig, he obtained
a professorship. During the reign of Edward VI. he re-visited
England and was employed by Cranmer in connection with the 1st<a name='Page_8'></a>
Liturgy of Edward VI. Returning to Leipsic he passed the remainder
of his days in peace and honour, and was twice elected
Rector of the University. His writings were both exegetical and
controversial, but chiefly the latter. They include <i>Expositio Libri
Psalmorum Davidis</i> (1550). His controversial works refer to such
subjects as the translation of the Bible into the vernacular, against
Servetus, etc.</p><br />

afterwards Bishop of Derry and Archbishop of Armagh. Her
<i>Hymns for Little Children</i> had reached its 69th edition before the
close of the century. Some of her hymns, <i>e.g.</i> &quot;There is a Green
Hill&quot; and &quot;The Roseate Hues of Early Dawn,&quot; are known wherever
English is spoken. Her husband has also written several books of
poetry, of which the most important is <i>St. Augustine's Holiday and
other Poems</i>.</p><br />

<a name='ALFORD_HENRY_1810_1871'></a><p><b>ALFORD, HENRY (1810-1871).</b>
&mdash;Theologian, scholar, poet,
and miscellaneous writer, <i>s.</i> of a clergyman, was <i>b.</i> in London.
After passing through various private schools, he proceeded to
Cambridge, where he had a distinguished career, and after entering
the Church and filling various preferments in the country, became
minister of Quebec Chapel, London, whence he was promoted to
be Dean of Canterbury. His great work was his <i>Greek Testament</i> in
4 vols., of which the first was <i>pub.</i> in 1849 and the last in 1861.
In this work he largely followed the German critics, maintaining,
however, a moderate liberal position; and it was for long the
standard work on the subject in this country. A. was one of the
most versatile men, and prolific authors, of his day, his works consisting
of nearly 50 vols., including poetry (<i>School of the Heart</i> and
<i>Abbot of Munchelnaye</i>, and a translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>), criticism,
sermons, etc. In addition to the works above mentioned he wrote
<i>Chapters on the Greek Poets</i> (1841), the <i>Queen's English</i> (1863), and
many well-known hymns, and he was the first editor of the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>. He was also an accomplished artist and musician.
His industry was incessant and induced a premature breakdown in
health, which terminated in his death in 1871. He was the friend of
most of his eminent contemporaries, and was much beloved for his
amiable character.</p><br />

<a name='ALISON_ARCHIBALD_1757_1839'></a><p><b>ALISON, ARCHIBALD (1757-1839).</b>
&mdash;Didactic and philosophical
writer, was <i>b.</i> in Edinburgh and <i>ed.</i> at Glasgow University
and Oxford. After being presented to various livings in England,
A. came to Edinburgh as incumbent of St. Paul's Episcopal Chapel,
where he attained popularity as a preacher of sermons characterised
by quiet beauty of thought and grace of composition. His chief
contribution to literature is his <i>Essay on the Nature and Principles
of Taste</i> (1790), in which the &quot;association&quot; theory is supported.</p><br />

<a name='ALISON_SIR_ARCHIBALD_1792_1867'></a><p><b>ALISON, SIR ARCHIBALD (1792-1867).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of
the above, was <i>b.</i> at Kenley, Shropshire, and after studying under a
private tutor, and at Edinburgh University, was, in 1814, called to
the Bar, at which he ultimately attained some distinction, becoming
in 1834 Sheriff of Lanarkshire, in which capacity he rendered valuable
service in times of considerable difficulty. It was when travelling
in France in 1814 that he conceived the idea of his <i>History of
Europe</i>, which deals with the period from the outbreak of the French
Revolution to the restoration of the Bourbons, and extends, in its
<a name='Page_9'></a>original form (1833-42), to 10 vols. The work is one of vast
industry, and gives a useful account of an important epoch, but is
extremely diffuse and one-sided, and often prosy. Disraeli satirises
the author in <i>Coningsby</i> as Mr. Wordy, who wrote a history to prove
that Providence was on the side of the Tories. It had, however, an
enormous sale. A continuation of it (1852-59) brought the story
down to the accession of Louis Napoleon. A. was also the author
of a life of Marlborough, and of two standard works on the criminal
law of Scotland. In his private and official capacities he was highly
respected, and was elected Lord Rector successively of Marischal
Coll., Aberdeen, and of Glasgow University. He was created a
baronet by Lord Derby in 1852.</p><br />

<a name='ALLEN_CHARLES_GRANT_1848_1899'></a><p><b>ALLEN, CHARLES GRANT (1848-1899).</b>
&mdash;Scientific writer
and novelist, <i>b.</i> in Canada, to which his <i>f.</i>, a clergyman, had
emigrated, and <i>ed.</i> at Birmingham and Oxford. For a time he was
a professor in a college for negroes in Jamaica, but returning to
England in 1876 devoted himself to literature. His first books were
on scientific subjects, and include <i>Physiological &AElig;sthetics</i> (1877)
and <i>Flowers and Their Pedigrees</i>. After assisting Sir W.W. Hunter
in his <i>Gazeteer of India</i>, he turned his attention to fiction, and
between 1884 and 1899 produced about 30 novels, among which
<i>The Woman Who Did</i> (1895), promulgating certain startling views
on marriage and kindred questions, created some sensation.
Another work, <i>The Evolution of the Idea of God</i>, propounding a
theory of religion on heterodox lines, has the disadvantage of
endeavouring to explain everything by one theory. His scientific
works also included <i>Colour Sense</i>, <i>Evolutionist at Large</i>, <i>Colin
Clout's Calendar</i>, and the <i>Story of the Plants</i>, and among his novels
may be added <i>Babylon</i>, <i>In all Shades</i>, <i>Philistia</i> (1884), <i>The Devil's
Die</i>, and <i>The British Barbarians</i> (1896).</p><br />

<a name='ALLINGHAM_WILLIAM_1824_1889'></a><p><b>ALLINGHAM, WILLIAM (1824-1889).</b>
&mdash;Poet, the <i>s.</i> of a
banker of English descent, was <i>b.</i> at Ballyshannon, entered the
customs service, and was ultimately settled in London, where he
contributed to <i>Leigh Hunt's Journal</i>. Hunt introduced him to
Carlyle and other men of letters, and in 1850 he <i>pub.</i> a book of
poems, which was followed by <i>Day and Night Songs</i> (1854), <i>Laurence
Bloomfield in Ireland</i> (1864) (his most ambitious, though not his
most successful work), and <i>Collected Poems</i> in 6 vols. (1888-93).
He also edited <i>The Ballad Book</i> for the <i>Golden Treasury</i> series in
1864. In 1870 he retired from the civil service and became sub-editor
of <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> under Froude, whom he succeeded as
editor (1874-79). His verse is clear, fresh, and graceful. He married
Helen Paterson, the water colourist, whose idylls have made
the name of &quot;Mrs. Allingham&quot; famous also. He <i>d.</i> in 1889.
Other works are <i>Fifty Modern Poems</i> (1865), <i>Songs, Poems, and
Ballads</i> (1877), <i>Evil May Day</i> (1883), <i>Blackberries</i> (1884), <i>Irish
Songs and Poems</i> (1887), and <i>Varieties in Prose</i> (1893). A selection
from his diaries and autobiography was <i>pub.</i> in 1906<a name='Page_10'></a>.</p><br />

<a name='ALLSTON_WASHINGTON_1779_1843'></a><p><b>ALLSTON, WASHINGTON (1779-1843).</b>
&mdash;Painter and poet,
<i>b.</i> in S. Carolina, became a distinguished painter, and also wrote a
good deal of verse including <i>The Sylphs of the Seasons</i>, etc. (1813),
and <i>The Two Painters</i>, a satire. He also produced a novel, <i>Monaldi</i>.
He was known as &quot;the American Titian.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='AMORY_THOMAS_1691_1788'></a><p><b>AMORY, THOMAS (1691(?)-1788).</b>
&mdash;Eccentric writer, was of
Irish descent. In 1755 he <i>publ.</i> <i>Memoirs containing the lives of
several ladies of Great Britain, a History of Antiquities and Observations
on the Christian Religion</i>, which was followed by the <i>Life of
John Buncle</i> (1756), practically a continuation. The contents of
these works are of the most miscellaneous description&mdash;philology,
natural science, theology, and, in fact, whatever occurred to the
writer, treated without any system, but with occasional originality
and felicity of diction. The author, who was probably more or less
insane, is described as having a very peculiar aspect, with the
manner of a gentleman, scarcely ever stirring abroad except at
dusk. He reached the age of 97.</p><br />

<a name='ANDERSON_ALEXANDER_1845_1909'></a><p><b>ANDERSON, ALEXANDER (1845-1909).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a
quarrier at Kirkconnel, Dumfriesshire, became a surfaceman on the
railway. Spending all his leisure in self-culture, he mastered
German, French, and Spanish sufficiently to read the chief masterpieces
in these languages. His poetic vein, which was true if somewhat
limited in range, soon manifested itself, and his first book,
<i>Songs of Labour</i>, appeared in 1873, and there followed <i>Two Angels</i>
(1875), <i>Songs of the Rail</i> (1878), and <i>Ballads and Sonnets</i> (1879). In
the following year he was made assistant librarian in the University
of Edinburgh, and after an interval as secretary to the Philosophical
Institution there, he returned as Chief Librarian to the university.
Thereafter he wrote little. Of a simple and gentle character, he
made many friends, including the Duke of Argyll, Carlyle, and Lord
Houghton. He generally wrote under the name of &quot;Surfaceman.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='ANDREWES_LANCELOT_1555_1626'></a><p><b>ANDREWES, LANCELOT (1555-1626).</b>
&mdash;Churchman and
scholar, was <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i> at Merchant Taylor's School and
Cambridge, where he took a fellowship and taught divinity. After
receiving various other preferments he became Dean of Westminster,
and a chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Elizabeth, who, however, did
not advance him further on account of his opposition to the alienation
of ecclesiastical revenues. On the accession, however, of
James I., to whom his somewhat pedantic learning and style of
preaching recommended him, he rose into great favour, and was
made successively Bishop of Chichester, of Ely, and, in 1618, of
Winchester. He attended the Hampton Court Conference, and
took part in the translation of the Bible, known as the <i>Authorised
Version</i>, his special work being given to the earlier parts of the Old
Testament: he acted, however, as a sort of general editor. He was
considered as, next to Ussher, the most learned churchman of his
day, and enjoyed a great reputation as an eloquent and impassioned
preacher, but the stiffness and artificiality of his style render
his sermons unsuited to modern taste. His doctrine was High
Church, and in his life he was humble, pious, and charitable.<a name='Page_11'></a>
Ninety-six of his sermons were published in 1631 by command of
Charles I.</p>

<p>There are lives by A.T. Russell (1863), and R.L. Ottley (1894);

a wealthy clergyman, rector of Brinkley, Cambridgeshire, was <i>ed.</i>
at Eton and Cambridge. He <i>pub.</i> in 1766 a satirical poem of considerable
sparkle, <i>The New Bath Guide</i>, from which Smollett is said
to have drawn largely in his <i>Humphrey Clinker</i>. He made many
other excursions into literature which are hardly remembered, and
ended his days as a country squire at the age of eighty.</p><br />

<a name='DARBLAY_FRANCES_BURNEY_1752_1840'></a><p><b>D'ARBLAY, FRANCES (BURNEY) (1752-1840).</b>
&mdash;Novelist,
<i>dau.</i> of Dr. Charles B., a musician of some distinction, was <i>b.</i> at Lynn
Regis, where her <i>f.</i> was organist. Her mother having died while
she was very young, and her <i>f.</i>, who had come to London, being too busy
to give her any attention, she was practically self-educated. Her
first novel, <i>Evelina</i>, <i>pub.</i> anonymously in 1778, at once by its narrative
and comic power, brought her fame, and, through <a href='#PIOZZI_HESTER_LYNCH_SALUSBURY_1741_1821'>Mrs. Thrale</a>
(<i>q.v.</i>), she made the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, with whom she
became a great favourite. Her next literary venture was a comedy,
<i>The Witlings</i>; but, by the advice of her <i>f.</i>, it was not put upon the
stage. In 1782, however, she produced <i>Cecilia</i>, which, like its predecessor,
had an enormous sale, and which, though not perhaps so
popular as <i>Evelina</i>, added to her fame. She now became the friend
of Burke and other distinguished persons, including Mrs. Delaney,
through whom she became known to the royal family, and was
offered the appointment of Second Keeper of the Robes, which,
with some misgivings, she accepted. This situation did not prove a
happy one, the duties being menial, the society uncongenial, and the
court etiquette oppressive and injurious to her health, and in 1791
she obtained permission to retire on a pension of &pound;100. She had,
during her connection with the court, continued her <i>Diary</i>, which
she had begun in girlhood, and continued during her whole life,
and which during this period contains many interesting accounts of
persons and affairs of note. She married (1793) Gen. D'Arblay, a
French <i>emigr&eacute;</i>, their only income being her slender pension. This
she endeavoured to increase by producing a tragedy, <i>Edwy and
Elvira</i>, which failed. In 1795 she <i>pub.</i> by subscription another
novel, <i>Camilla</i>, which, though it did not add to her reputation, considerably
improved her circumstances, as it is said to have brought
her &pound;3000. After some years spent in France, where her husband
had obtained employment, she returned to England and <i>pub.</i> her
last novel, <i>The Wanderer</i>, which fell flat. Her only remaining work
was a life of her father, written in an extraordinarily grandiloquent
style. She died in 1840, aged 87.</p><br />

<a name='ARBUTHNOT_JOHN_1667_1735'></a><p><b>ARBUTHNOT, JOHN (1667-1735).</b>
&mdash;Physician and satirist,
was <i>b.</i> in Kincardineshire, and after studying at Aberdeen and
Oxford, took his degree of M.D. at St. Andrews. Settling in London,
he taught mathematics. Being by a fortunate accident at Epsom,
he was called in to prescribe for Prince George, who was suddenly
taken ill there, and was so successful in his treatment that he was
<a name='Page_12'></a>appointed his regular physician. This circumstance made his professional
fortune, for his ability enabled him to take full advantage
of it, and in 1705 he became physician to the Queen. He became
the cherished friend of Swift and Pope, and himself gained a high
reputation as a wit and man of letters. His principal works are the
<i>Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus</i>, partly by Pope, but to which he
was the chief contributor, the <i>History of John Bull</i> (1712), mainly
against the Duke of Marlborough, <i>A Treatise concerning the Altercation
or Scolding of the Ancients</i>, and the <i>Art of Political Lying</i>.
He also wrote various medical treatises, and dissertations on
ancient coins, weights, and measures. After the death of Queen
Anne, A. lost his court appointments, but this, as well as more
serious afflictions with which he was visited, he bore with serenity
and dignity. He was an honourable and amiable man, one of the
very few who seems to have retained the sincere regard of Swift,
whose style he made the model of his own, with such success that
writings by the one were sometimes attributed to the other: his
<i>Art of Political Lying</i> is an example. He has, however, none of the
ferocity of S.</p><br />

&mdash;Statesman
and writer on science, religion, and
politics, succeeded his <i>f.</i>, the 7th duke, in 1847. His talents and
eloquence soon raised him to distinction in public life. He acted
with the Liberal party until its break-up under the Irish policy of
Mr. Gladstone, after which he was one of the Unionist leaders. He
held the offices of Lord Privy Seal, Postmaster-General, and Indian
Secretary. His writings include <i>The Reign of Law</i> (1866), <i>Primeval
Man</i> (1869), <i>The Eastern Question</i> (1879), <i>The Unseen Foundations
of Society</i> (1893), <i>Philosophy of Belief</i> (1896), <i>Organic Evolution
Cross-examined</i> (1898). He was a man of the highest character,
honest, courageous, and clear-sighted, and, though regarded by
some professional scientists as to a certain extent an amateur, his
ability, knowledge, and dialectic power made him a formidable
antagonist, and enabled him to exercise a useful, generally conservative,
influence on scientific thought and progress.</p><br />

practised in London. He is remembered as the friend of Thomson,
Mallet, and other literary celebrities of the time, and as the author of
a poem on <i>The Art of Preserving Health</i>, which appeared in 1744,
and in which a somewhat unpromising subject for poetic treatment
is gracefully and ingeniously handled. His other works, consisting
of some poems and prose essays, and a drama, <i>The Forced
Marriage</i>, are forgotten, with the exception of the four stanzas at
the end of the first part of Thomson's <i>Castle of Indolence</i>, describing
the diseases incident to sloth, which he contributed.</p><br />

London, and Oxford. Thereafter he was an assistant master at
King Edward's School, Birmingham, and was in 1856 appointed
Principal of the Government Deccan College, Poona. Here he
<a name='Page_13'></a>received the bias towards, and gathered material for, his future
works. In 1861 he returned to England and became connected
with <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, of which he was ultimately editor. The
literary task which he set before him was the interpretation in
English verse of the life and philosophy of the East. His chief work
with this object is <i>The Light of Asia</i> (1879), a poem on the life and
teaching of Buddha, which had great popularity, but whose permanent
place in literature must remain very uncertain. In <i>The Light
of the World</i> (1891), he attempted, less successfully, a similar treatment
of the life and teaching of Jesus. Other works are <i>The Song of
Songs of India</i> (1875), <i>With Saadi in the Garden</i>, and <i>The Tenth Muse</i>.
He travelled widely in the East, and wrote books on his travels.
He was made K.C.I.E. in 1888.</p><br />

<a name='ARNOLD_MATTHEW_1822_1888'></a><p><b>ARNOLD, MATTHEW (1822-1888).</b>
&mdash;Poet and critic, <i>s.</i> of
<a href='#ARNOLD_THOMAS_1795_1842'>Dr. A.</a>, of Rugby (<i>q.v.</i>), was <i>b.</i> at Laleham and <i>ed.</i> at Rugby, Winchester,
and Balliol Coll., Oxford, becoming a Fellow of Oriel in
1845. Thereafter he was private secretary to Lord Lansdowne,
Lord President of the Council, through whose influence he was in
1851 appointed an inspector of schools. Two years before this he
had <i>pub.</i> his first book of poetry, <i>The Strayed Reveller</i>, which he
soon withdrew: some of the poems, however, including &quot;Mycerinus&quot;
and &quot;The Forsaken Merman,&quot; were afterwards republished,
and the same applies to his next book, <i>Empedocles on
Etna</i> (1852), with &quot;Tristram and Iseult.&quot; In 1857 he was appointed
to the Professorship of Poetry at Oxford, which he held for ten
years. After this he produced little poetry and devoted himself to
criticism and theology. His principal writings are, in poetry,
<i>Poems</i> (1853), containing &quot;Sohrab and Rustum,&quot; and &quot;The
Scholar Gipsy;&quot; <i>Poems, 2nd Series</i> (1855), containing &quot;Balder
Dead;&quot; <i>Merope</i> (1858); <i>New Poems</i> (1867), containing &quot;Thyrsis,&quot; an
elegy on <a href='#CLOUGH_ARTHUR_HUGH_1819_1861'>A.H. Clough</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), &quot;A Southern Night,&quot; &quot;Rugby
Chapel,&quot; and &quot;The Weary Titan&quot;; in prose he wrote <i>On Translating
Homer</i> (1861 and 1862), <i>On the Study of Celtic Literature</i> (1867),
<i>Essays in Celtic Literature</i> (1868), <i>2nd Series</i> (1888), <i>Culture and
Anarchy</i> (1869), <i>St. Paul and Protestantism</i> (1870), <i>Friendship's
Garland</i> (1871), <i>Literature and Dogma</i> (1873), <i>God and the Bible</i>
(1875), <i>Last Essays on Church and Religion</i> (1877), <i>Mixed Essays</i>
(1879), <i>Irish Essays</i> (1882), and <i>Discourses in America</i> (1885). He
also wrote some works on the state of education on the Continent.
In 1883 he received a pension of &pound;250. The rationalistic tendency
of certain of his writings gave offence to many readers, and the
sufficiency of his equipment in scholarship for dealing with some of
the subjects which he handled was called in question; but he undoubtedly
exercised a stimulating influence on his time; his writings are
characterised by the finest culture, high purpose, sincerity, and
a style of great distinction, and much of his poetry has an exquisite
and subtle beauty, though here also it has been doubted whether
high culture and wide knowledge of poetry did not sometimes take
the place of the true poetic fire.</p>

Oxford, and after some years as a tutor, was, in 1828, appointed
Head Master of Rugby. His learning, earnestness, and force of
character enabled him not only to raise his own school to the front
rank of public schools, but to exercise an unprecedented reforming
influence on the whole educational system of the country. A
liberal in politics, and a zealous church reformer, he was involved
in many controversies, educational and religious. As a churchman
he was a decided Erastian, and strongly opposed to the High Church
party. In 1841 he was appointed Professor of Modern History
at Oxford. His chief literary works are his unfinished <i>History of
Rome</i> (three vols. 1838-42), and his <i>Lectures on Modern History</i>.

Wingfield, and then at St. John's Coll., Cambridge, where he devoted
himself specially to the study of Greek, then newly revived,
and of which, having taken a fellowship, he became a teacher. He
was likewise noted for his skill in penmanship, music, and archery,
the last of which is the subject of his first work, <i>Toxophilus</i>, <i>pub.</i> in
1545, and which, dedicated to Henry VIII., gained him the favour
of the King, who bestowed a pension upon him. The objects of the
book are twofold, to commend the practice of shooting with the long
bow as a manly sport and an aid to national defence, and to set
the example of a higher style of composition than had yet been
attempted in English. Soon afterwards he was made university
orator, and master of languages to the Lady (afterwards Queen)
Elizabeth. He then went abroad in various positions of trust,
returning on being appointed Latin Secretary to Edward VI. This
office he likewise discharged to Mary and then to Elizabeth&mdash;a
testimony to his tact and caution in these changeful times. His
principal work, <i>The Schoolmaster</i>, a treatise on education, was

he <i>pub.</i> in an unlucky hour a pamphlet to prove that death was not
obligatory upon Christians, which, much to his surprise, aroused
the public wrath and led to his expulsion from the Irish and English

studied science, including astrology. The result of his studies in
this region of mystery was his <i>Theatrum Chymicum Britannicum</i>,
which gained him great repute and the friendship of John Selden.
His last astrological treatise was <i>The Way to Bliss</i>, which dealt with
the subject of &quot;the philosopher's stone.&quot; He also wrote various
works on antiquarian subjects, and a <i>History of the Order of the

on the High Church side in the ecclesiastical controversies of his
time, and is believed to have been the chief author of the famous
defence of Dr. Sacheverell in 1712. He also wrote most of Boyle's
<i>Examination of Dr. Bentley's Dissertations on the Epistles of
Phalaris</i>, and <i>pub.</i> sermons, which, with his letters to Swift, Pope,
and other friends, constitute the foundation of his literary reputation.
During the reign of the Tories he enjoyed much preferment,
having been successively Canon of Exeter, Dean of Christ Church,
Dean of Westminster, and Bishop of Rochester. His Jacobite
principles, however, and his participation in various plots got him
into trouble, and in 1722 he was confined in the Tower, deprived of
all his offices, and ultimately banished. He <i>d.</i> at Paris, Feb. 15,

which he lost by litigation and otherwise. He devoted himself to
the collection of antiquarian and miscellaneous observations, and
gave assistance to Dugdale and Anthony &agrave;-Wood in their researches.
His own investigations were extensive and minute, but their value
is much diminished by his credulity, and want of capacity to weigh
evidence. His only publication is his <i>Miscellanies</i>, a collection of
popular superstitions, etc., but he left various collections, which
were edited and <i>publ.</i> in the 19th century.</p><br />

<a name='AUSTEN_JANE_1775_1817'></a><p><b>AUSTEN, JANE (1775-1817).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>dau.</i> of a clergyman,
was <i>b.</i> at the rectory of Steventon near Basingstoke. She
<a name='Page_16'></a>received an education superior to that generally given to girls of
her time, and took early to writing, her first tale being begun in
1798. Her life was a singularly uneventful one, and, but for a disappointment
in love, tranquil and happy. In 1801 the family went
to Bath, the scene of many episodes in her writings, and after the
death of her <i>f.</i> in 1805 to Southampton, and later to Chawton, a
village in Hants, where most of her novels were written. A tendency
to consumption having manifested itself, she removed in
May, 1817, to Winchester for the advantage of skilled medical
attendance, but so rapid was the progress of her malady that she
died there two months later. Of her six novels, four&mdash;<i>Sense and
Sensibility</i> (1811), <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (1813), <i>Mansfield Park</i> (1814)
and <i>Emma</i> (1816)&mdash;were <i>pub.</i> anonymously during her life-time;
and the others, <i>Northanger Abbey</i>&mdash;written in 1798&mdash;and <i>Persuasion</i>,
finished in 1816, appeared a few months after her death, when the
name of the authoress was divulged. Although her novels were
from the first well received, it is only of comparatively late years
that her genius has gained the wide appreciation which it deserves.
Her strength lies in the delineation of character, especially of
persons of her own sex, by a number of minute and delicate touches
arising out of the most natural and everyday incidents in the life of
the middle and upper classes, from which her subjects are generally
taken. Her characters, though of quite ordinary types, are drawn
with such wonderful firmness and precision, and with such significant
detail as to retain their individuality absolutely intact through
their entire development, and they are never coloured by her own
personality. Her view of life is genial in the main, with a strong
dash of gentle but keen satire: she appeals rarely and slightly to
the deeper feelings; and the enforcement of the excellent lessons
she teaches is left altogether to the story, without a word of formal
moralising. Among her admirers was Sir W. Scott, who said,
&quot;That young lady has a talent for describing the involvements of
feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most
wonderful I ever met with;&quot; others were Macaulay (who thought
that in the world there were no compositions which approached
nearer to perfection), Coleridge, Southey, Sydney Smith, and E.
FitzGerald.</p><br />

but devoted himself to the study of law as a science, and became
Professor of Jurisprudence in London University 1826-32. Thereafter
he served on various Royal Commissions. By his works he

and <i>ed.</i> there, and was brought up to the law, which, however, as
he said, he &quot;followed but could never overtake.&quot; He became a
contributor to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> in 1836, and continued his
connection with it until his death. In it appeared most of his
humorous prose pieces, such as <i>The Glenmutchkin Railway</i>, <i>How I
Became a Yeoman</i>, and <i>How I Stood for the Dreepdaily Burghs</i>, all full
of vigorous fun. In the same pages began to appear his chief
poetical work, the <i>Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers</i>, and a novel, partly
autobiographical, <i>Norman Sinclair</i>. Other works were <i>The Bon
Gaultier Ballads</i>, jointly with Theodore Martin, and <i>Firmilian, a
Spasmodic Tragedy</i>, under the <i>nom-de-plume</i> of T. Percy Jones, intended
to satirise a group of poets and critics, including Gilfillan,
Dobell, Bailey, and Alexander Smith. In 1845 A. obtained the
Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres in Edinburgh University,
which he filled with great success, raising the attendance from 30
to 150, and in 1852 he was appointed sheriff of Orkney and Shetland.

<a name='BACON_FRANCIS_LORD_VERULAM_AND_VISCOUNT_ST_ALBANS_1561_1626'></a><p><b>BACON, FRANCIS, LORD VERULAM, AND VISCOUNT ST. ALBAN'S (1561-1626).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher
and statesman, was the
youngest <i>s.</i> of Sir Nicholas B., Lord Keeper, by his second wife, a
<i>dau.</i> of Sir Anthony Cooke, whose sister married William Cecil, Lord
Burghley, the great minister of Queen Elizabeth. He was <i>b.</i> at
York House in the Strand on Jan. 22, 1561, and in his 13th year
was sent with his elder brother Anthony to Trinity Coll., Cambridge.
Here he first met the Queen, who was impressed by his precocious
intellect, and was accustomed to call him &quot;the young Lord Keeper.&quot;
Here also he became dissatisfied with the Aristotelian philosophy as
being unfruitful and leading only to resultless disputation. In 1576
he entered Gray's Inn, and in the same year joined the embassy of
Sir Amyas Paulet to France, where he remained until 1579. The
death of his <i>f.</i> in that year, before he had completed an intended
provision for him, gave an adverse turn to his fortunes, and rendered
it necessary that he should decide upon a profession. He accordingly
returned to Gray's Inn, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to
induce Burghley to give him a post at court, and thus enable him
to devote himself to a life of learning, he gave himself seriously to the
study of law, and was called to the Bar in 1582. He did not, however,
desert philosophy, and <i>pub.</i> a Latin tract, <i>Temporis Partus
Maximus</i> (the Greatest Birth of Time), the first rough draft of his
own system. Two years later, in 1584, he entered the House of
Commons as member for Melcombe, sitting subsequently for
Taunton (1586), Liverpool (1589), Middlesex (1593), and Southampton
(1597). In the Parliament of 1586 he took a prominent
part in urging the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. About this
time he seems again to have approached his powerful uncle, the
result of which may possibly be traced in his rapid progress at the
Bar, and in his receiving, in 1589, the reversion to the Clerkship of
<a name='Page_18'></a>the Star Chamber, a valuable appointment, into the enjoyment of
which, however, he did not enter until 1608. About 1591 he
formed a friendship with the Earl of Essex, from whom he received
many tokens of kindness ill requited. In 1593 the offices of
Attorney-general, and subsequently of Solicitor-general became
vacant, and Essex used his influence on B.'s behalf, but unsuccessfully,
the former being given to Coke, the famous lawyer. These
disappointments may have been owing to a speech made by B. on a
question of subsidies. To console him for them Essex presented
him with a property at Twickenham, which he subsequently sold
for &pound;1800, equivalent to a much larger sum now. In 1596 he was
made a Queen's Counsel, but missed the appointment of Master of
the Rolls, and in the next year (1597), he <i>pub.</i> the first edition of
his <i>Essays</i>, ten in number, combined with <i>Sacred Meditations</i>
and the <i>Colours of Good and Evil</i>. By 1601 Essex had lost
the Queen's favour, and had raised his rebellion, and B. was one of
those appointed to investigate the charges against him, and examine
witnesses, in connection with which he showed an ungrateful and
indecent eagerness in pressing the case against his former friend and
benefactor, who was executed on Feb. 25, 1601. This act B.
endeavoured to justify in <i>A Declaration of the Practices and Treasons,
etc., of ... the Earl of Essex, etc.</i> His circumstances had for some
time been bad, and he had been arrested for debt: he had, however,
received a gift of a fine of &pound;1200 on one of Essex's accomplices. The
accession of James VI. in 1603 gave a favourable turn to his fortunes:
he was knighted, and endeavoured to set himself right with the new
powers by writing his <i>Apologie</i> (defence) of his proceedings in the
case of Essex, who had favoured the succession of James. In the
first Parliament of the new king he sat for St. Alban's, and was
appointed a Commissioner for Union with Scotland. In 1605 he
<i>pub.</i> <i>The Advancement of Learning</i>, dedicated, with fulsome
flattery, to the king. The following year he married Alice Barnham,
the <i>dau.</i> of a London merchant, and in 1607 he was made
Solicitor-General, and wrote <i>Cogita et Visa</i>, a first sketch of the
<i>Novum Organum</i>, followed in 1609 by <i>The Wisdom of the Ancients</i>.
Meanwhile (in 1608), he had entered upon the Clerkship of the Star
Chamber, and was in the enjoyment of a large income; but old
debts and present extravagance kept him embarrassed, and he
endeavoured to obtain further promotion and wealth by supporting
the king in his arbitrary policy. In 1613 he became Attorney-General,
and in this capacity prosecuted Somerset in 1616. The
year 1618 saw him Lord Keeper, and the next Lord Chancellor
and Baron Verulam, a title which, in 1621, he exchanged for that
of Viscount St. Albans. Meanwhile he had written the <i>New Atlantis</i>,
a political romance, and in 1620 he presented to the king the <i>Novum
Organum</i>, on which he had been engaged for 30 years, and which
ultimately formed the main part of the <i>Instauratio Magna</i>. In his
great office B. showed a failure of character in striking contrast with
the majesty of his intellect. He was corrupt alike politically and
judicially, and now the hour of retribution arrived. In 1621 a
Parliamentary Committee on the administration of the law charged
him with corruption under 23 counts; and so clear was the evidence
that he made no attempt at defence. To the lords, who sent a
<a name='Page_19'></a>committee to inquire whether the confession was really his, he
replied, &quot;My lords, it is my act, my hand, and my heart; I beseech
your lordships to be merciful to a broken reed.&quot; He was sentenced
to a fine of &pound;40,000, remitted by the king, to be committed to the
Tower during the king's pleasure (which was that he should be
released in a few days), and to be incapable of holding office or
sitting in parliament. He narrowly escaped being deprived of his
titles. Thenceforth he devoted himself to study and writing. In
1622 appeared his <i>History of Henry VII.</i>, and the 3rd part of the
<i>Instauratio</i>; in 1623, <i>History of Life and Death</i>, the <i>De Augmentis
Scientarum</i>, a Latin translation of the <i>Advancement</i>, and in 1625
the 3rd edition of the <i>Essays</i>, now 58 in number. He also <i>pub.</i>
<i>Apophthegms</i>, and a translation of some of the <i>Psalms</i>. His life
was now approaching its close. In March, 1626, he came to London,
and shortly after, when driving on a snowy day, the idea struck him
of making an experiment as to the antiseptic properties of snow, in
consequence of which he caught a chill, which ended in his death on
9th April 1626. He left debts to the amount of &pound;22,000. At the
time of his death he was engaged upon <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i>. The
intellect of B. was one of the most powerful and searching ever
possessed by man, and his developments of the inductive philosophy
revolutionised the future thought of the human race. The most
popular of his works is the <i>Essays</i>, which convey profound and
condensed thought in a style that is at once clear and rich. His
moral character was singularly mixed and complex, and bears no
comparison with his intellect. It exhibits a singular coldness and
lack of enthusiasm, and indeed a bluntness of moral perception
and an absence of attractiveness rarely combined with such
extraordinary mental endowments. All that was possible to be
done in defence of his character and public conduct has been done
by his accomplished biographer and editor, <a href='#SPEDDING_JAMES_1808_1881'>Mr. Spedding</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).
Singular, though of course futile, attempts, supported sometimes
with much ingenuity, have been made to claim for B. the authorship
of Shakespeare's plays, and have indeed been extended so as
to include those of Marlowe, and even the <i>Essays</i> of Montaigne.</p>

&mdash;Philosopher, studied at
Oxford and Paris. His scientific acquirements, regarded in that
<a name='Page_20'></a>age as savouring of witchcraft, and doubtless also his protests
against the ignorance and immorality of the clergy, excited the
jealousy and hatred of the Franciscans, and he was in consequence
imprisoned at Paris for ten years. Clement IV., who had been a
sympathiser, desired on his accession to see his works, and in
response B. sent him <i>Opus Majus</i>, a treatise on the sciences
(grammar, logic, mathematics, physics, and philosophy), followed
by <i>Opus Secundum</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>. Clement, however, was
near death when they arrived. B. was comparatively free from
persecution for the next ten years. But in 1278 he was again imprisoned
for upwards of ten years. At the intercession of some
English noblemen he was at last released, and spent his remaining
years at Oxford. He possessed one of the most commanding intellects
of his own, or perhaps of any, age, and, notwithstanding all
the disadvantages and discouragements to which he was subjected,
made many discoveries, and came near to many more. There is
still preserved at Oxford a rectified calendar in which he approximates
closely to the truth. He received the sobriquet of the
&quot;Doctor Mirabilis.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='BAGE_ROBERT_1728_1801'></a><p><b>BAGE, ROBERT (1728-1801).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i> in Derbyshire,
was the <i>s.</i> of a paper-maker. It was not until he was 53 that he took
to literature; but in the 15 years following he produced 6 novels, of
which Sir Walter Scott says that &quot;strong mind, playful fancy, and
extensive knowledge are everywhere apparent.&quot; B., though brought
up as a Quaker, imbibed the principles of the French Revolution.
He was an amiable and benevolent man, and highly esteemed.
<i>Hermsprong; or, Man as He is Not</i> (1796) is considered the best of his
novels, of which it was the last. The names of the others are
<i>Mount Kenneth</i> (1781), <i>Barham Downs</i> (1784), <i>The Fair Syrian</i>
(1787), <i>James Wallace</i> (1788), and <i>Man as He is</i> (1792).</p><br />

one. He lived at Nottingham, Jersey, Ilfracombe, London, and
again at Nottingham, where he <i>d.</i> He travelled a good deal
on the Continent. He was by profession a barrister, but never
practised, and devoted his whole energies to poetry. His first
poem, <i>Festus</i> (1839), is, for the daring of its theme and the imaginative
power and moral altitude which it displays, one of the most
notable of the century; as the work of one little past boyhood it is
a prodigy of intellectual precocity. Along with its great qualities
it has many faults in execution, and its final place in literature
<a name='Page_21'></a>remains to be determined. It was <i>pub.</i> anonymously, and had
great success, but has fallen into unmerited, but perhaps temporary,
neglect. Among its greatest admirers was Tennyson. The subsequent
poems of B., <i>The Angel World</i> (1850), <i>The Mystic</i> (1855), <i>The
Age</i> (1858), and <i>The Universal Hymn</i> (1867), were failures, and the
author adopted the unfortunate expedient of endeavouring to
buoy them up by incorporating large extracts in the later editions
of <i>Festus</i>, with the effect only of sinking the latter, which ultimately
extended to over 40,000 lines. B. was a man of strikingly
handsome appearance, and gentle and amiable character.</p><br />

and John Hunter, and her brother was the celebrated physician,
Matthew B., of London. She received a thorough education at
Glasgow, and at an early age went to London, where the remainder
of her long, happy, and honoured, though uneventful, life was
passed. In 1798, when she was 36, the first vol. of her <i>Plays on the
Passions</i> appeared, and was received with much favour, other two
vols. followed in 1802 and 1812, and she also produced <i>Miscellaneous
Plays</i> in 1804, and 3 vols. of <i>Dramatic Poetry</i> in 1836. In
all her works there are many passages of true and impressive poetry,
but the idea underlying her <i>Plays on the Passions</i>, that, namely, of
exhibiting the principal character as acting under the exclusive
influence of one passion, is artificial and untrue to nature.</p><br />

Scotland, and also of the Westminster Assembly, 1643. In 1651 he
was made Professor of Divinity in Glasgow, and 10 years later

from Ireland to Holland, but returned on the accession of Elizabeth,
who made him a Prebendary of Canterbury. His chief work
is a Latin <i>Account of the Lives of Eminent Writers of Great Britain</i>.
Besides this he wrote some dramas on scriptural subjects, and an
account of the trial and death of Sir John Oldcastle. He wrote in

in Germany, where he became acquainted and corresponded with
Goethe, Hegel, and other leaders of German thought. Returning
to America he began his <i>History of the United States</i> (1834-74). The
work covers the period from the discovery of the Continent to the
conclusion of the Revolutionary War in 1782. His other great work
is <i>The History of the Formation of the Constitution of the United
States</i> (1882). B. filled various political offices, and was in 1846
Minister Plenipotentiary to England, and in 1867 Minister to
Prussia. His writing is clear and vigorous, and his facts generally

<a name='BANIM_JOHN_1798_1842'></a><p><b>BANIM, JOHN (1798-1842).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, began life as a
miniature painter, but was led by the success of his first book,
<i>Tales of the O'Hara Family</i>, to devote himself to literature. The
object which he set before himself was to become to Ireland what
Scott has been to Scotland, and the influence of his model is distinctly
traceable in his writings. His strength lies in the delineation
of the characters of the Irish lower classes, and the impulses,
often misguided and criminal, by which they are influenced, and
in this he has shown remarkable power. The first series of the
<i>O'Hara Tales</i> appeared in 1825, the second in 1826. Other works
are <i>The Croppy</i> (1828), <i>The Denounced</i> (1830), <i>The Smuggler</i> (1831),
<i>The Mayor of Windgap</i>, and his last, <i>Father Connell</i>. Most of
these deal with the darker and more painful phases of life, but the
feeling shown in the last-named is brighter and tenderer. B.
latterly suffered from illness and consequent poverty, which were
alleviated by a pension from Government. He also wrote some
poems, including <i>The Celt's Paradise</i>, and one or two plays. In the
<i>O'Hara Tales</i>, he was assisted by his brother, MICHAEL BANIM
(1796-1874), and there is difficulty in allocating their respective
contributions. After the death of John, Michael wrote <i>Clough
Fionn</i> (1852), and <i>The Town of the Cascades</i> (1864).</p><br />

1773 she <i>pub.</i> a collection of miscellaneous poems, which was well
received, and in the following year she married the Rev. R. Barbauld,
a French Protestant and dissenting minister, who also conducted
a school near Palgrave in Suffolk. Into this enterprise Mrs.
B. threw herself with great energy, and, mainly owing to her
talents and reputation, it proved a success and was afterwards
<a name='Page_24'></a>carried on at Hampstead and Newington Green. Meantime, she
continued her literary occupations, and brought out various devotional
works, including her <i>Hymns in Prose for Children</i>. These
were followed by <i>Evenings at Home</i>, <i>Selections from the English

a selection from the British novelists with introductory essay.</p><br />

<a name='BARBOUR_JOHN_1316_1395'></a><p><b>BARBOUR, JOHN (1316?-1395).</b>
&mdash;Poet. Of B.'s youth
nothing is certainly known, but it is believed that he was <i>b.</i> near
Aberdeen, and studied at Oxford and Paris. He entered the Church,
and rose to ecclesiastical preferment and Royal favour. He is
known to have been Archdeacon of Aberdeen in 1357, when, and
again in 1364, he went with some young scholars to Oxford, and he
also held various civil offices in connection with the exchequer and
the King's household. His principal poem, <i>The Bruce</i>, was in progress
in 1376. It consists of 14,000 octosyllabic lines, and celebrates
the praises of Robert the Bruce and James Douglas, the
flowers of Scottish chivalry. This poem is almost the sole authority
on the history it deals with, but is much more than a rhyming
chronicle; it contains many fine descriptive passages, and sings the
praises of freedom. Its style is somewhat bald and severe. Other
poems ascribed to B. are <i>The Legend of Troy</i>, and <i>Legends of the
Saints</i>, probably translations. B. devoted a perpetual annuity of
20 shillings, bestowed upon him by the King, to provide for a mass
to be sung for himself and his parents, and this was duly done in the
church of St. Machar until the Reformation.</p>

of Scottish birth, was a priest in England. He is remembered for
his satirical poem, <i>The Ship of Fools</i> (1509), partly a translation,
which is of interest as throwing light on the manners and customs
of the times to which it refers. He also translated Sallust's <i>Bellum
Jugurthinum</i>, and the <i>Mirrour of Good Manners</i>, from the Italian of
Mancini, and wrote five <i>Eclogues</i>. His style is stiff and his verse
uninspired.</p><br />

his <i>f.</i> to England about 1603. He wrote several works in English
and Latin, among which are <i>Euphormionis Satyricon</i>, against the

of which his uncle was Rector, made such progress in study as
to gain the admiration of his teachers, specially of his uncle, who
offered to make him his heir if he would remain in France, and join
the Roman Catholic Church. This he refused to do, and, returning
to Scotland, he in 1667 adopted the principles of the Quakers
as his <i>f.</i> had already done. Soon afterwards he began to write in
<a name='Page_25'></a>defence of his sect, by <i>pub.</i> in 1670 <i>Truth cleared of Calumnies</i>, and
<i>a Catechism and Confession of Faith</i> (1673). His great work, however,
is his <i>Apology for the Quakers</i>, <i>pub.</i> in Latin in 1676, and
translated into English in 1678. It is a weighty and learned work,
written in a dignified style, and was eagerly read. It, however,
failed to arrest the persecution to which the Quakers were exposed,
and B. himself, on returning from the Continent, where he
had gone with Foxe and Penn, was imprisoned, but soon regained
his liberty, and was in the enjoyment of Court favour. He was one
of the twelve Quakers who acquired East New Jersey, of which he
was appointed nominal Governor. His latter years were spent at his

betook himself to law, and finally to commerce and diplomacy, in
the former of which he made a fortune. He was much less successful
as a poet than as a man of affairs. His writings include <i>Vision of

in 1858, and a collected edition of his poems appeared in 1879.
His philological works include <i>Philological Grammar</i> (1854), <i>Se
Gefylsta, an Anglo-Saxon Delectus</i> (1849). <i>Tiw, or a View of Roots</i>

of variations in graceful verse of the 2nd Eclogue of Virgil. His
next work was <i>Cynthia, with certain Sonnets and the Legend of Cassandra</i>
in 1595; and in 1598 there appeared a third vol., <i>The
Encomion of Lady Pecunia, etc.</i>, in which are two songs (&quot;If music

in <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>, an unauthorised collection, and
which were long attributed to Shakespeare. From this time, 1599,
B. produced nothing else, and seems to have retired to the life of
a country gentleman at Stone in Staffordshire, in the church of
which he was buried in 1627. He was for long neglected; but his
poetry is clear, sweet, and musical. His gift indeed is sufficiently
attested by work of his having passed for that of Shakespeare.</p><br />

<a name='BARROW_ISAAC_1630_1677'></a><p><b>BARROW, ISAAC (1630-1677).</b>
&mdash;Divine, scholar, and
mathematician, <i>s.</i> of a linen-draper in London, was <i>ed.</i> at Charterhouse,
Felsted, Peterhouse, and Trinity Coll., Cambridge, where
his uncle and namesake, afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph, was a
Fellow. As a boy he was turbulent and pugnacious, but soon took
to hard study, distinguishing himself in classics and mathematics.
Intending originally to enter the Church, he was led to think of
the medical profession, and engaged in scientific studies, but soon
reverted to his first views. In 1655 he became candidate for the
Greek Professorship at Cambridge, but was unsuccessful, and
travelled for four years on the Continent as far as Turkey. On his
return he took orders, and, in 1660, obtained the Greek Chair at
Cambridge, and in 1662 the Gresham Professorship of Geometry,
which he resigned on being appointed first Lucasian Professor of
Mathematics in the same university. During his tenure of this
chair he <i>pub.</i> two mathematical works of great learning and
elegance, the first on Geometry and the second on Optics. In 1669
he resigned in favour of his pupil, Isaac Newton, who was long
considered his only superior among English mathematicians.
About this time also he composed his <i>Expositions of the Creed</i>, <i>The
Lord's Prayer</i>, <i>Decalogue</i>, and <i>Sacraments</i>. He was made a D.D.
by royal mandate in 1670, and two years later Master of Trinity Coll.,
where he founded the library. Besides the works above mentioned,
he wrote other important treatises on mathematics, but in literature
his place is chiefly supported by his sermons, which are masterpieces
of argumentative eloquence, while his treatise on the <i>Pope's
Supremacy</i> is regarded as one of the most perfect specimens of controversy
in existence. B.'s character as a man was in all respects
<a name='Page_27'></a>worthy of his great talents, though he had a strong vein of eccentricity.
He <i>d.</i> unmarried in London at the early age of 47. B.'s

as a clerk in a bank. He became the friend of Southey, Lamb, and
other men of letters. His chief works are <i>The Convict's Appeal</i>
(1818), a protest against the severity of the criminal code of the time,
and <i>Household Verses</i> (1845), which came under the notice of Sir R.
Peel, through whom he obtained a pension of &pound;100. With the exception

&mdash;Philosopher, <i>s.</i>
of a Baptist minister, <i>b.</i> at Wellington, Somerset, intended to study
for Baptist ministry, and was at a theological seminary at Bath
with that view, but being strongly attracted to philosophical studies,
left it and went to Edin., when he became the favourite pupil of <a href='#HAMILTON_SIR_WILLIAM_1788_1856'>Sir
W. Hamilton</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), of whose philosophical system he continued an
adherent. After working as ed. of a newspaper in Edinburgh, and after
an interval of rest rendered necessary by a breakdown in health, he
resumed journalistic work in 1858 as assistant ed. of the <i>Daily News</i>.
In 1864 he was appointed Prof. of Logic and English Literature at
St. Andrews, in which capacity his mind was drawn to the study of
Shakespeare, and he contributed to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> and
<i>Fraser's Magazine</i> valuable papers (chiefly relating to his vocabulary
and the extent of his learning) afterwards collected as <i>Shakespeare
Studies</i>. In 1873 he was appointed to superintend the ninth ed.
of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, in which, after 1880, he was assisted
by <a href='#SMITH_WILLIAM_ROBERTSON_1846_1894'>W. Robertson Smith</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p><br />

<a name='BAXTER_RICHARD_1615_1691'></a><p><b>BAXTER, RICHARD (1615-1691).</b>
&mdash;Divine scholar and controversialist,
was <i>b.</i> of poor, but genteel, parents at Rowton in
Shropshire, and although he became so eminent for learning, was not
<i>ed.</i> at any university. Circumstances led to his turning his attention
to a career at court under the patronage of the Master of the Revels,
but a short experience of this sufficed; and giving himself to the
Christian ministry, he was ordained in 1638, and, after being master
of a school at Dudley, exercised his ministry successively at Bridgnorth
and Kidderminster. His learning and capacity for business
made him the leader of the Presbyterian party. He was one of the
greatest preachers of his own day, and consistently endeavoured to
exert a moderating influence, with the result that he became the
object of attack by extremists of opposing views. Though siding
with the Parliament in the Civil War, he opposed the execution of the
King and the assumption of supreme power by Cromwell. During
the war he served with the army as a chaplain. On the return of
Charles II., B. was made one of his chaplains, and was offered the see
of Hereford, which he declined, and his subsequent request to be
<a name='Page_28'></a>allowed to return to Kidderminster was refused. He subsequently
suffered persecution at the hands of Judge Jeffreys. After the
Revolution he had a few years of peace and quiet. His literary
activity was marvellous in spite of ill-health and outward disturbance.
He is said to have written 168 works, the best known of
which are <i>The Saints' Everlasting Rest</i> (1650), and <i>Call to the Unconverted</i>
(1657), manuals of practical religion; and, among his controversial
writings, <i>Methodus Theologi&aelig;</i> (1681), and <i>Catholic Theology</i>
(1675), in which his theological standpoint&mdash;a compromise between
Arminianism and Calvinism&mdash;is set forth. Dr. Isaac Barrow says
that &quot;his practical writings were never mended, and his controversial
seldom confuted,&quot; and Dean Stanley calls him &quot;the chief
English Protestant schoolman.&quot; B. left an autobiography,
<i>Reliqui&aelig; Baxterian&aelig;</i>, which was a favourite book with both Johnson
and Coleridge. Other works by him are <i>The Life of Faith</i> (1670),
<i>Reasons of the Christian Religion</i> (1672), and <i>Christian Directory</i>
(1675). <i>Practical Works</i> in 23 vols. (1830) edited with memoirs by
W. Orme, also <i>Lives</i> by A.B. Grosart (1879), Dean Boyle (1883), and

writer, <i>s.</i> of a wealthy lawyer in Bath. Originally intended for the
law, he changed his mind and thought of entering the Church, but
abandoned this idea also, and gave himself to writing for the stage
and the periodical press. He is chiefly known for his songs, of
which he wrote hundreds, which, set to the music of Bishop and
other eminent composers, found universal acceptance. Some were
set to his own music. He also wrote several novels and a number
of farces, etc. Although making a large income from his writings,
in addition to that of his wife, he fell into embarrassed circumstances.
Among the best known of his songs are <i>I'd be a Butterfly</i>, <i>Oh, no, we
never mention Her</i>, and <i>She wore a Wreath of Roses</i>. He may be
regarded as, excepting Moore, the most popular song writer of his

&mdash;Statesman
and novelist, was the <i>s.</i> of <a href='#DISRAELI_ISAAC_1766_1848'>Isaac D.</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). Belonging
to a Jewish family settled first in Spain, whence in the 15th
century they migrated to Italy, he was <i>b.</i> in London in 1804 and
privately <i>ed.</i> His <i>f.</i> destined him for the law, and he was articled
to a solicitor. The law was, however, uncongenial, and he had
already begun to write. After some journalistic work, he brought
himself into general notice by the publication, in 1827, of his first
novel, <i>Vivian Grey</i>, which created a sensation by its brilliance,
audacity, and slightly veiled portraits of living celebrities. After
producing a <i>Vindication of the British Constitution</i>, and some political
pamphlets, he followed up his first success by a series of novels, <i>The
Young Duke</i> (1831), <i>Contarini Fleming</i> (1832), <i>Alroy</i> (1833), <i>Venetia
<a name='Page_29'></a>and Henrietta Temple</i> (1837). During the same period he had also
written <i>The Revolutionary Epic</i> and three burlesques, <i>Ixion</i>, <i>The Infernal
Marriage</i>, and <i>Popanilla</i>. These works had gained for him a
brilliant, if not universally admitted, place in literature. But his
ambition was by no means confined to literary achievement; he
aimed also at fame as a man of action. After various unsuccessful
attempts to enter Parliament, in which he stood, first as a Radical,
and then as a Tory, he was in 1837 returned for Maidstone, having
for his colleague Mr. Wyndham Lewis, whose widow he afterwards
married. For some years after entering on his political career, D.
ceased to write, and devoted his energies to parliamentary work.
His first speech was a total failure, being received with shouts of
laughter, but with characteristic courage and perseverance he pursued
his course, gradually rose to a commanding position in parliament
and in the country, became leader of his party, was thrice Chancellor
of the Exchequer, 1852, 1858-59, and 1866-68, in which last
year he became Prime Minister, which office he again held from 1874
till 1880. To return to his literary career, in 1844 he had <i>pub.</i> <i>Coningsby</i>,
followed by <i>Sybil</i> (1845), and <i>Tancred</i> (1847), and in 1848 he
wrote a life of Lord G. Bentinck, his predecessor in the leadership of
the Protectionist party. His last novels were <i>Lothair</i> (1870), and
<i>Endymion</i> (1880). He was raised to the peerage as Earl of Beaconsfield
in 1876, and was a Knight of the Garter. In his later years he
was the intimate friend as well as the trusted minister of Queen
Victoria. The career of D. is one of the most remarkable in English
history. With no family or political influence, and with some
personal characteristics, and the then current prejudices in regard to
his race to contend with, he rose by sheer force of will and intellect
to the highest honours attainable in this country. His most marked
qualities were an almost infinite patience and perseverance, indomitable
courage, a certain spaciousness of mind, and depth of penetration,
and an absolute confidence in his own abilities, aided by great
powers of debate rising occasionally to eloquence. Though the
object, first of a kind of contemptuous dislike, then of an intense
opposition, he rose to be universally regarded as, at all events, a
great political force, and by a large part of the nation as a great
statesman. As a writer he is generally interesting, and his books
teem with striking thoughts, shrewd maxims, and brilliant phrases
which stick in the memory. On the other hand he is often artificial,
extravagant, and turgid, and his ultimate literary position is difficult
to forecast.</p>

&mdash;Poet and philosophical

and <i>ed.</i> at Aberdeen; he was, in 1760, appointed Professor
of Moral Philosophy there. In the following year he <i>pub.</i> a
vol. of poems, which attracted attention. The two works, however,
which brought him most fame were: (1) his <i>Essay on Truth</i>
(1770), intended as an answer to Hume, which had great immediate
success, and led to an introduction to the King, a pension of &pound;200,
and the degree of LL.D. from Oxford; and (2) his poem of <i>The<a name='Page_30'></a>
Minstrel</i>, of which the first book was <i>pub.</i> in 1771 and the second in
1774, and which constitutes his true title to remembrance. It contains
much beautiful descriptive writing. The <i>Essay on Truth</i> and
his other philosophical works are now forgotten. B. underwent
much domestic sorrow in the death of his wife and two promising
sons, which broke down his own health and spirits.</p><br />

&mdash;Poets
and dramatists. As they are indissolubly
associated in the history of English literature, it is convenient to
treat of them in one place. B. was the <i>s.</i> of Francis B., a Judge of
the Common Pleas, and was <i>b.</i> at the family seat, Grace Dieu,
Leicestershire. He was <i>ed.</i> at Oxford, but his <i>f.</i> dying in 1598, he
left without taking his degree. He went to London and entered the
Inner Temple in 1600, and soon became acquainted with Ben
Jonson, Drayton, and other poets and dramatists. His first work
was a translation from Ovid, followed by commendatory verses prefixed
to certain plays of Jonson. Soon afterwards his friendship
with F. began. They lived in the same house and had practically a
community of goods until B.'s marriage in 1613 to Ursula, <i>dau.</i> and
co-heiress of Henry Isley of Sundridge in Kent, by whom he had
two <i>dau.</i> He <i>d.</i> in 1616, and is buried in Westminster Abbey. F.
was the youngest <i>s.</i> of Richard F., Bishop of London, who accompanied
Mary Queen of Scots to the scaffold. He went to Cambridge,
but it is not known whether he took a degree, though he had some
reputation as a scholar. His earliest play is <i>The Woman Hater</i>
(1607). He is said to have died of the plague, and is buried in St.
Saviour's Church, Southwark. The plays attributed to B. and F.
number 52 and a masque, and much labour has been bestowed by
critics in endeavouring to allocate their individual shares. It is
now generally agreed that others collaborated with them to some
extent&mdash;Massinger, Rowley, Shirley, and even Shakespeare. Of
those believed to be the joint work of B. and F. <i>Philaster</i> and <i>The
Maid's Tragedy</i> are considered the masterpieces, and are as dramas
unmatched except by Shakespeare. <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> is
thought to contain the work of Shakespeare. As regards their
respective powers, B. is held to have had the graver, solider, and
more stately genius, while F. excelled in brightness, wit, and gaiety.
The former was the stronger in judgment, the latter in fancy. The
plays contain many very beautiful lyrics, but are often stained by
gross indelicacy. The play of <i>Henry VIII.</i> included in Shakespeare's
works, is now held to be largely the work of F. and Massinger.

writer, only <i>s.</i> of William B., Lord Mayor of London, the associate and
supporter of John Wilkes, inherited at the age of 9 an enormous
fortune. In these circumstances he grew up wayward and extravagant,
showing, however, a strong bent towards literature. His education
was entrusted to a private tutor, with whom he travelled
extensively on the Continent. At the age of 22 he produced his oriental
romance, <i>Vathek</i> (<i>c.</i> 1781), written originally in French and,
as he was accustomed to boast, at a single sitting of three days and
two nights. There is reason, however, to believe that this was a
flight of imagination. It is an impressive work, full of fantastic and
magnificent conceptions, rising occasionally to sublimity. His
other principal writings are <i>Memoirs of Extraordinary Painters</i> (1780),
a satirical work, and <i>Letters from Italy with Sketches of Spain and
Portugal</i> (1835), full of brilliant descriptions of scenes and manners.
B.'s fame, however, rests nearly as much upon his eccentric extravagances
as a builder and collector as upon his literary efforts. In
carrying out these he managed to dissipate his fortune of &pound;100,000 a
year, only &pound;80,000 of his capital remaining at his death. He sat in

medicine. He then wandered about practising his profession, and
expounding democratic theories which got him into trouble. He <i>d.</i>
at Bale in mysterious circumstances. For some time before his
death he had been engaged upon a drama, <i>Death's Jest Book</i>, which
was published in 1850 with a memoir by his friend, T.F. Kelsall. B.
had not the true dramatic instinct, but his poetry is full of thought

deacon in 692 and priest in 703, he spent most of his days at
Jarrow, where his fame as a scholar and teacher of Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew brought him many disciples. Here likewise he <i>d.</i> and was
buried, but his bones were, towards the beginning of the 11th century,
removed to Durham. The well-deserved title of &quot;Venerable&quot;
usually prefixed to his name first appears in 836. He was the most
learned Englishman of his age. His industry was marvellous, and
its results remain embodied in about 40 books, of which about 25
are commentaries on books of Scripture. The others are lives of
saints and martyrs, and his two great works, <i>The Ecclesiastical
History of England</i> and the scientific treatise, <i>De Natura Rerum</i>.
The former of these gives the fullest and best information we have
as to the history of England down to the year 731, and the latter is
an encyclop&aelig;dia of the sciences as then known. In the anxious care
with which he sought out and selected reliable information, and

and critic, <i>b.</i> in Yorkshire of humble parentage, went at the age of 14
<a name='Page_34'></a>to Camb., afterwards had charge of a school at Spalding, and then
becoming tutor to the <i>s.</i> of <a href='#STILLINGFLEET_EDWARD_1635_1699'>Dr. Stillingfleet</a>, Dean of St. Paul's,
afterwards Bishop of Worcester (<i>q.v.</i>), accompanied his pupil to
Oxf. After taking his degree at both universities, and entering
the Church, he laid the foundation of his reputation as perhaps the
greatest scholar England has produced by his letter in Mill's ed.
of the <i>Chronicle of John Malelas</i>, and his <i>Dissertation on the Letters
of Phalaris</i> (1699), which spread his fame through Europe. After
receiving various preferments, including the Boyle lectureship and
the Keepership of the Royal Library, he was, in 1700, appointed
Master of Trinity, and afterwards was, largely owing to his own
pugnacity and rapacity, which were almost equal to his learning,
involved in a succession of litigations and controversies. These
lasted for 20 years, and led to the temporary loss of his academic
preferments and honours. In 1717, however, he was appointed
Regius Prof. of Divinity. During the contentions referred to he
continued his literary activity without abatement, and <i>pub.</i> various
ed. of the classics, including Horace and Terence. He was much less
successful in certain emendations of Milton which he attempted.
Having incurred the resentment of Pope he was rewarded by being
assigned a niche in <i>The Dunciad!</i> His style is strong and nervous,
and sparkles with wit and sarcasm. His classical controversies
called forth Swift's <i>Battle of the Books</i>.</p>

<a name='BERKELEY_GEORGE_1685_1753'></a><p><b>BERKELEY, GEORGE (1685-1753).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher, eldest <i>s.</i>
of William B., a cadet of the noble family of Berkeley, <i>b.</i> at Kilcrin
near Kilkenny, and <i>ed.</i> at the school of his native place and at
Trinity Coll., Dublin, where he graduated and took a Fellowship in
1707. His earliest publication was a mathematical one; but the
first which brought him into notice was his <i>Essay towards a New
Theory of Vision</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1709. Though giving rise to much controversy
at the time, its conclusions are now accepted as an established
part of the theory of optics. There next appeared in 1710 the
<i>Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</i>, which was
followed in 1713 by <i>Dialogues between Hylas</i> and <i>Philonous</i>, in which
he propounded his system of philosophy, the leading principle of
which is that the world as represented to our senses depends for its
existence on being perceived. Of this theory the <i>Principles</i> gives the
exposition and the <i>Dialogues</i> the defence. One of his main objects
was to combat the prevailing materialism of the time. A theory so
novel was, as might be expected, received with widespread ridicule,
though his genius was realised by some of the more elect spirits,
such as Dr. S. Clarke. Shortly afterwards B. visited England, and
was received into the circle of Addison, Pope, and Steele. He then
went to the Continent in various capacities, and on his return was
made Lecturer in Divinity and Greek in his university, D.D. in 1721,
<a name='Page_35'></a>and Dean of Derry in 1724. In 1725 he formed the project of
founding a college in Bermuda for training ministers for the colonies,
and missionaries to the Indians, in pursuit of which he gave up his
deanery with its income of &pound;1100, and went to America on a salary
of &pound;100. Disappointed of promised aid from Government he returned,
and was appointed Bishop of Cloyne. Soon afterwards
he <i>pub.</i> <i>Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher</i>, directed
against Shaftesbury, and in 1734-37 <i>The Querist</i>. His last publications
were <i>Siris</i>, a treatise on the medicinal virtues of tar-water,
and <i>Further Thoughts on Tar-water</i>. He <i>d.</i> at Oxford in 1753. His
affectionate disposition and genial manners made him much beloved.
As a thinker his is the greatest name in English philosophy between
Locke and Hume. His style is clear and dignified.</p>

<p>The best ed. of B. is Prof. A.C. Fraser's, with Life (4 vols., 1871,
and new, 1902); there is also a small work by the same (1881).</p><br />

<a name='BESANT_SIR_WALTER_1836_1901'></a><p><b>BESANT, SIR WALTER (1836-1901).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and historian
of London, <i>b.</i> at Portsmouth and <i>ed.</i> at King's Coll., London, and
Camb., was for a few years a professor at Mauritius, but a breakdown
in health compelled him to resign, and he returned to England and
took the duties of Secretary to the Palestine Exploration Fund,
which he held 1868-85. He <i>pub.</i> in 1868 <i>Studies in French Poetry</i>.
Three years later he began his collaboration with <a href='#RICE_JAMES_1844_1882'>James Rice</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).
Among their joint productions are <i>Ready-money Mortiboy</i> (1872), and
the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> (1876), both, especially the latter, very successful.
This connection was brought to an end by the death of Rice in
1882. Thereafter B. continued to write voluminously at his own
hand, his leading novels being <i>All in a Garden Fair</i>, <i>Dorothy Forster</i>
(his own favourite), <i>Children of Gibeon</i>, and <i>All Sorts and Conditions
of Men</i>. The two latter belonged to a series in which he endeavoured
to arouse the public conscience to a sense of the sadness of life among
the poorest classes in cities. In this crusade B. had considerable
success, the establishment of The People's Palace in the East of
London being one result. In addition to his work in fiction B.
wrote largely on the history and topography of London. His plans
<a name='Page_36'></a>in this field were left unfinished: among his books on this subject
is <i>London in the 18th Century</i>.</p>

<p>Other works among novels are <i>My Little Girl</i>, <i>With Harp and
Crown</i>, <i>This Son of Vulcan</i>, <i>The Monks of Thelema</i>, <i>By Celia's

pieces, which had considerable popularity, the best known of which
are <i>Love in a Village</i> (1762), and <i>The Maid of the Mill</i>. Owing to
misconduct he was dismissed from being an officer in the Marines,
and had ultimately, in 1772, to fly the country. The remainder of
his life seems to have been passed in penury and misery. The

he went to London, and soon after <i>pub.</i> his first novel, <i>James Merle</i>,
which made no impression. In the Austro-Prussian War he acted
as a war correspondent. Thereafter he began afresh to write
fiction, and was more successful; the publication of <i>A Daughter of
Heth</i> (1871) at once established his popularity. He reached his
highwater-mark in <i>A Princess of Thule</i> (1873). Many other books
were added before his death in 1898, among which may be mentioned
<i>In Silk Attire</i> (1869), <i>The Strange Adventures of a Ph&aelig;ton</i>

&mdash;Scholar and man
of letters, <i>b.</i> in Glasgow, and <i>ed.</i> at the Universities of Aberdeen and
Edin., after which he travelled and studied in Germany and
Italy. Returning to Scotland he was, in 1834, admitted to the
Scottish Bar, but did not practise. His first work was his translation
of <i>Faust</i> (1834), which won the approbation of Carlyle.
From 1841-52 B. was Prof. of Humanity (Latin) in Aberdeen,
and from 1852-82, when he retired, of Greek in Edinburgh. His
<a name='Page_37'></a>literary activity was incessant, his works consisting of translations
of <i>&AElig;schylus</i> and of the <i>Iliad</i>, various books of poetry, including
<i>Lays and Legends of Ancient Greece</i>, and treatises on religious,
philosophical, and political subjects, among which may be mentioned
<i>Self-Culture</i> (1873), <i>Hor&aelig; Hellenic&aelig;</i>, and a life of Burns. He was an
enthusiastic champion of Scottish nationality. Possessed of great
conversational powers and general versatility, his picturesque
eccentricity made him one of the most notable members of Scottish
society. It was owing to his efforts that a Chair of Celtic Language
and Literature was established in Edinburgh University.</p><br />

He began to write poetry at the age of 12, and studied for the
Church. He was appointed Minister of Kirkcudbright, but was
objected to by the parishioners on account of his blindness, and
gave up the presentation on receiving an annuity. He then retired
to Edinburgh, where he took pupils. He <i>pub.</i> some miscellaneous
poems, which are now forgotten, and is chiefly remembered for
having written a letter to Burns, which had the effect of dissuading
him from going to the West Indies. He was made D.D. in 1767.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, one
of the Court Physicians to William III. and Anne, wrote several
very long and well-intentioned, but dull and tedious, poems, which,
though praised by Addison and Johnson, are now utterly forgotten.
They include <i>Prince Arthur</i>, <i>Creation</i>, <i>Redemption</i>, <i>Alfred</i>. As may
be imagined, they were the subject of derision by the profaner wits
of the day. B. was a successful physician and an excellent man.</p><br />

<a name='BLACKMORE_RICHARD_DODDRIDGE_1825_1900'></a><p><b>BLACKMORE, RICHARD DODDRIDGE (1825-1900).</b>
&mdash;Novelist
and poet, <i>b.</i> at Longworth, Berks, <i>ed.</i> at Tiverton School
and Oxf., practised for a short time as a lawyer but, owing to his
health, gave this up, and took to market-gardening and literature at
Teddington. His first <i>pub.</i> was <i>Poems by Melanter</i> (1853), followed
by <i>Epullia</i> (1855), <i>The Bugle of the Black Sea</i> (1855), etc.; but he
soon found that fiction, not poetry, was his true vocation. Beginning
with <i>Clara Vaughan</i> in 1864, he produced fifteen novels, all of
more than average, and two or three of outstanding merit. Of
these much the best in the opinion of the public, though not of the
author, is <i>Lorna Doone</i> (1869), the two which rank next to it being
<i>The Maid of Sker</i> (1872) (the author's favourite) and <i>Springhaven</i>
(1887). Others are <i>Cradock Nowell</i> (1866), <i>Alice Lorraine</i> (1875),
<i>Cripps the Carrier</i> (1876), <i>Mary Anerley</i> (1880), and <i>Christowell</i>
(1882). One of the most striking features of B.'s writings is his
marvellous eye for, and sympathy with, Nature. He may be said
to have done for Devonshire what Scott did for the Highlands. He
has been described as &quot;proud, shy, reticent, strong-willed, sweet-tempered,
and self-centred.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='BLACKSTONE_SIR_WILLIAM_1723_1780'></a><p><b>BLACKSTONE, SIR WILLIAM (1723-1780).</b>
&mdash;Legal Writer,
posthumous <i>s.</i> of a silk mercer in London, was <i>ed.</i> at Charterhouse
School and Oxf., and entered the Middle Temple in 1741. His
great work is his <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i>, in 4 vols.<a name='Page_38'></a>
(1765-1769), which still remains the best general history of the
subject. It had an extraordinary success, and is said to have
brought the author &pound;14,000. B. was not a man of original mind, nor
was he a profound lawyer; but he wrote an excellent style, clear and
dignified, which brings his great work within the category of general
literature. He had also a turn for neat and polished verse, of
which he gave proof in <i>The Lawyer's Farewell to his Muse</i>.</p><br />

&mdash;Divine, and man of letters,
<i>b.</i> and <i>ed.</i> at Edin. After being minister at Collessie in Fife, he was
translated to Edinburgh, where he filled various pulpits, latterly
that of the High Church. In 1759 he commenced a series of lectures
on composition, and soon after the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles
Lettres was founded, to which he was appointed. His <i>Lectures</i> were
<i>pub.</i> on his resignation of the chair in 1783. His chief fame, however,
rests upon his <i>Sermons</i>, in 4 vols., which had an extraordinary
popularity, and obtained for him a pension of &pound;200. Time has not
sustained the opinion of his contemporaries: they have been described
as feeble in thought though elegant in style, and even as &quot;a
bucket of warm water.&quot; B. was amiable, kind to young authors,
and remarkable for a harmless, but rather ridiculous vanity and
simplicity.</p><br />

<a name='BLAIR_ROBERT_1699_1746'></a><p><b>BLAIR, ROBERT (1699-1746).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Edin., where
his <i>f.</i> was a clergyman, became minister of Athelstaneford, Haddingtonshire.
His sole work was <i>The Grave</i>, a poem in blank verse
extending to 767 lines of very various merit, in some passages rising
to great sublimity, and in others sinking to commonplace. It was
illustrated by <a href='#BLAKE_WILLIAM_1757_1827'>William Blake</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) B.'s <i>s.</i>, Robert, was a very
distinguished Scottish judge and Lord President of the Court of

author of <i>Douglas</i>.</p><br />

<a name='BLAKE_WILLIAM_1757_1827'></a><p><b>BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757-1827).</b>
&mdash;Poet and painter, <i>b.</i> in
London, was from earliest youth a seer of visions and a dreamer of
dreams, seeing &quot;Ezekiel sitting under a green bough,&quot; and &quot;a tree
full of angels at Peckham,&quot; and such he remained to the end of his
days. His teeming imagination sought expression both in verse and
in drawing, and in his 14th year he was apprenticed to James Basire,
an eminent engraver, and thereafter studied at the Royal Academy.
Among his chief artistic works were illustrations for Young's <i>Night
Thoughts</i>, Blair's <i>Grave</i>, &quot;Spiritual Portraits,&quot; and his finest work,
&quot;Inventions to the Book of Job,&quot; all distinguished by originality
and imagination. In literature his <i>Songs of Innocence</i> appeared in
1789, <i>Songs of Experience</i> in 1794. These books were literally made
by Blake and his heaven-provided wife; poems and designs alike
being engraved on copper by B. and bound by Mrs. B. In like
fashion were produced his mystical books, <i>The Book of Thel</i> (1789),
<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> (1790), <i>The Gates of Paradise</i>,
<i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i>, <i>Europe</i>, <i>The Book of Urizen</i> (1794),
<i>The Book of Los</i> and <i>The Book of Ahania</i> (1795). His last books
were <i>Jerusalem</i> and <i>Milton</i>. His earlier and shorter pieces, <i>e.g.</i> &quot;The
Chimney-Sweeper,&quot; &quot;Holy Thursday,&quot; &quot;The Lamb,&quot; &quot;The Sun-flower,&quot;
&quot;The Tiger,&quot; etc., have an exquisite simplicity arising from
<a name='Page_39'></a>directness and intensity of feeling&mdash;sometimes tender, sometimes
sublime&mdash;always individual. Latterly he lost himself in clouds of
mysticism. A truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood
by the world, but appreciated by an elect few, he led a
cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and
celestial inspirations.</p><br />

&mdash;Poetess, was of good
Cumberland family, and received the sobriquet of &quot;The Muse of
Cumberland.&quot; Her poems, which were not collected until 1842,
depict Cumbrian life and manners with truth and vivacity. She
also wrote some fine songs in the Scottish dialect, including &quot;Ye

whom she travelled much on the Continent, where she met Lord
Byron, her <i>Conversations</i> with whom she <i>pub.</i> in 1834. This is the
only one of her books which has any value. The others were slight
works on Travel, such as <i>The Idler in Italy</i>, annuals, and novels.

&mdash;Is
spoken of by John Major in his <i>History of Scotland</i> as a wandering
minstrel, skilled in the composition of rhymes in the Scottish
tongue, who &quot;fabricated&quot; a book about William Wallace, and
gained his living by reciting it to his own accompaniment on the
harp at the houses of the nobles. Harry claims that it was founded
on a Latin <i>Life of Wallace</i> written by Wallace's chaplain, John
Blair, but the chief sources seem to have been traditionary. Harry
is often considered inferior to Barbour as a poet, and has little of his
moral elevation, but he surpasses him in graphic power, vividness of
description, and variety of incident. He occasionally shows the
influence of Chaucer, and is said to have known Latin and French.</p><br />

<i>Songs and Sonnets</i> (1893), <i>Birds of Passage</i> (1895), etc. She also

<a name='BLOOMFIELD_ROBERT_1766_1823'></a><p><b>BLOOMFIELD, ROBERT (1766-1823).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Honington
in Suffolk, lost his <i>f.</i> when he was a year old, and received the
rudiments of education from his mother, who kept the village school.
While still a boy he went to London, and worked as a shoemaker
under an elder brother, enduring extreme poverty. His first and
chief poem, <i>The Farmer's Boy</i>, was composed in a room where half a
dozen other men were at work, and the finished lines he carried in his
head until there was time to write them down. The manuscript,
after passing through various hands, fell into those of Capel Lofft, a
Suffolk squire of literary tastes, by whose exertions it was <i>pub.</i><a name='Page_40'></a>
with illustrations by Bewick in 1800. It had a signal success,
26,000 copies having been sold in three years. The Duke of Grafton
obtained for him an appointment in the Seal Office, and when,
through ill-health, he was obliged to resign this, allowed him a
pension of 1s. a day. Other works were <i>Rural Tales</i> (1804), <i>Wild
Flowers</i> (1806), <i>The Banks of the Wye</i> (1811), and <i>May Day with the
Muses</i> (1817). An attempt to carry on business as a bookseller
failed, his health gave way, his reason was threatened, and he <i>d.</i> in
great poverty at Shefford in 1823. B.'s poetry is smooth, correct,
and characterised by taste and good feeling, but lacks fire and energy.
Of amiable and simple character, he was lacking in self-reliance.</p><br />

<i>Belvidere, or the Garden of the Muses</i> (1600), and <i>England's Helicon</i>
(1600). Mr. Bullen says that B. did not himself ed. any of the
Elizabethan miscellanies attributed to him by bibliographers: but
that he projected their publication, and he befriended the editors.</p><br />

<a name='BOECE_or_BOETHIUS_HECTOR_1465_1536'></a><p><b>BOECE, or BOETHIUS, HECTOR (1465?-1536).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
probably <i>b.</i> at Dundee, and <i>ed.</i> there and at Paris, where he was
a regent or professor, 1492 to 1498. While there he made the
acquaintance of Erasmus. Returning to Scotland he co-operated
with Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, in founding the univ. there
of which he was the first Principal. His literary fame rests on
two works, his <i>Lives of the Bishops of Mortlach and Aberdeen</i>, in
which his friend Elphinstone figures prominently, and his <i>History of
Scotland</i> to the accession of James III. These works were, of course,
composed in Latin, but the <i>History</i> was translated into Scottish
prose by John Bellenden, 1530 to 1533, and into English for Hollinshed's
<i>Chronicle</i>. The only predecessor of the work was the compendium
of Major, and as it was written in a flowing and pleasing
style it became very popular, and led to ecclesiastical preferment
and Royal favour. B. shared in the credulity of his age, but the
charge of inventing his authorities formerly brought against him
has been shown to be, to some extent at any rate, unfounded.</p><br />

&mdash;Statesman
and philosopher, <i>s.</i> of Sir Henry St. J., <i>b.</i> at Battersea,
and <i>ed.</i> at Eton and perhaps Oxf., was during his youth noted
chiefly for dissipation, but entering Parliament in 1701 as a supporter
of Harley, soon made himself a name by his eloquence and talent.
He held office as War and Foreign Sec. successively, became a peer
in 1712, intrigued successfully against Harley, and formed an administration
during the last days of Queen Anne, with the intention
of bringing back the Stuarts, which was frustrated by the Queen's
<a name='Page_41'></a>death. On the arrival of George I. and the accession to power of
the Whigs, B. was impeached, and his name erased from the Roll of
Peers. He went to France, and became Sec. of State to the Pretender
James, who, however, dismissed him in 1716, after which he
devoted himself to philosophy and literature. In 1723 he was pardoned
and returned to England, and an act was passed in 1725
restoring his forfeited estates, but still excluding him from the House
of Lords. He thereupon retired to his house, Dawley, near Uxbridge,
where he enjoyed the society of Swift and Pope, on the
latter of whom he exerted a strong influence. After some ineffectual
efforts to regain a position in political life, he returned to France
in 1735, where he remained for 7 years, and wrote most of his chief
works.</p>

<p>B. was a man of brilliant and versatile talents, but selfish, insincere,
and intriguing, defects of character which led to his political
ruin. His writings, once so much admired, reflect his character in
their glittering artificiality, and his pretensions to the reputation of
a philosopher have long been exploded; the chief of them are <i>Reflections
upon Exile</i>, <i>Letters on the Study of History</i> (in which he
attacked Christianity), <i>Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism</i>, and <i>Idea
of a Patriot King</i>. He left his MSS. to <a href='#MALLET_originally_MALLOCH_DAVID_1705_1765'>David Mallet</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), who

in 1867 was translated to Edin. In 1853 he was made D.D. of
Aberdeen. He was a voluminous and highly popular author, and
in addition to many books and tracts wrote a number of hymns,
many of which, <i>e.g.</i>, &quot;I heard the voice of Jesus say,&quot; are known all
over the English-speaking world. A selection of these was <i>pub.</i> as

places, including Glasgow, and was employed in various capacities
by T. Cromwell. He travelled widely, going as far as Jerusalem,
and wrote descriptions of the countries he had visited. His <i>Dyetary</i>

author, and traveller, <i>b.</i> at East Dereham, Norfolk, <i>s.</i> of a
recruiting officer, had a somewhat wandering childhood. He received
most of his education in Edin., and showed a peculiar talent
for acquiring languages. After being for a short time in the office of
a solicitor in Norwich, he travelled widely on the Continent and in
the East, acquainting himself with the people and languages of the
various countries he visited. He specially attached himself to the<a name='Page_42'></a>
Gipsies, with whose language he became so familiar as to <i>pub.</i> a dictionary
of it. His learning was shown by his publishing at St.
Petersburg <i>Targum</i>, a work containing translations from 30
languages. B. became a travelling agent of the Bible Society, and
his book, <i>The Bible in Spain</i> (1843), giving an account of his remarkable
adventures in that country, made his literary reputation. It
was followed by <i>Lavengro</i> (1851), and its sequel, <i>Romany Rye</i> (1857),
and <i>Wild Wales</i> (1862), which, though works of originality and extreme
interest, and now perhaps his most popular books, were received
with less public favour. The two first give a highly coloured
picture of his own story. He translated the New Testament into
Manchu. In his latter years he settled at Oulton Broad, Norfolk,
where he <i>d.</i> B. was a man of striking appearance and great vigour

schoolmaster at Glencairn, and minister of Simprin in
Berwickshire, and Ettrick in Selkirkshire. In addition to his best-known
work, <i>The Fourfold State</i>, one of the religious classics of
Scotland, he wrote an original little book, <i>The Crook in the Lot</i>, and
a learned treatise on the Hebrew points. He also took a leading
part in the Courts of the Church in what was known as the &quot;Marrow
Controversy,&quot; regarding the merits of an English work, <i>The Marrow
of Modern Divinity</i>, which he defended against the attacks of the
&quot;Moderate&quot; party in the Church. B., if unduly introspective, was
a man of singular piety and amiability. His autobiography is an
interesting record of Scottish life, full of sincerity and tenderness,
and not devoid of humorous touches, intentional and otherwise.</p><br />

B. of Auchinleck, Ayrshire, one of the judges of the Supreme
Courts of Scotland, was <i>ed.</i> at the High School and Univ. of
Edin., and practised as an advocate. He travelled much on the
Continent and visited Corsica, where he became acquainted with the
patriot General Paoli. Fortunately for posterity he was in 1763
introduced to Dr. Johnson, and formed an acquaintance with him
which soon ripened into friendship, and had as its ultimate fruit the
immortal <i>Life</i>. He was also the author of several works of more or
less interest, including an <i>Account of Corsica</i> (1768), and <i>Journal of
Tour to the Hebrides</i> (in the company of Johnson) (1786). Vain and
foolish in an exceptional degree, and by no means free from more
serious faults, B. has yet produced the greatest biography in the
language. <i>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</i> appeared in 1791,
and at once commanded an admiration which has suffered no diminution
since. But by this time a cloud had fallen upon the author.
He had lost his excellent wife, his health had given way, the
<a name='Page_43'></a>intemperance to which he had always been subject had mastered
him, and he <i>d.</i> four years after the appearance of his great work. B.
was called to the English as well as to the Scottish Bar, but his
various foibles prevented his reaching any great success, and he had
also vainly endeavoured to enter on a political career. The question
has often been raised how a man with the characteristics of B.
could have produced so unique a work, and has been discussed at
length by Macaulay and by Carlyle, the former paradoxically arguing
that his supreme folly and meanness themselves formed his
greatest qualifications; the latter, with far deeper insight, that
beneath these there lay the possession of an eye to discern excellence
and a heart to appreciate it, intense powers of accurate observation
and a considerable dramatic faculty. His letters to William
Temple were discovered at Boulogne, and <i>pub.</i> 1857.</p><br />

Bristol. Soon afterwards he began to write plays, occasionally in
conjunction, of which the first, <i>London Assurance</i> (1841) had an
immediate success. He was an excellent actor, especially in
pathetic parts. His plays are for the most part adaptations, but
are often very ingenious in construction, and have had great
popularity. Among the best known are <i>The Colleen Bawn</i>, <i>Arrah-na-Pogue</i>,

degree in 1776, but did not practise, devoting himself instead to
the cause of prison reform. In 1818 he <i>pub.</i> his <i>Family Shakespeare</i>
in 10 vols., &quot;in which nothing is added to the original text, but
those words and expressions are omitted which cannot with propriety
be read aloud in a family.&quot; The work had considerable success, 4
editions having been <i>pub.</i> before 1824, and others in 1831, 1853, and
1861. It was, however, subjected to some criticism and ridicule,
and gave rise to the expression &quot;bowdlerise,&quot; always used in an
opprobrious sense. On the other hand, Mr. Swinburne has said,
&quot;More nauseous and foolish cant was never chattered than that
which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of B. No
man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who
made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and
imaginative children.&quot; B. subsequently essayed a similar enterprise
in regard to Gibbon, which, however, was not so successful.</p><br />

life Vicar of Bremhill, Wilts, and became Prebendary and Canon
Residentiary of Salisbury. His first work, <i>pub.</i> in 1789, was a
little vol. containing 14 sonnets, which was received with extraordinary
favour, not only by the general public, but by such men as
Coleridge and Wordsworth. It may be regarded as the harbinger of
the reaction against the school of Pope, in which these poets were
soon to bear so great a part. B. <i>pub.</i> several other poems of much
greater length, of which the best are <i>The Spirit of Discovery</i> (1805),
and <i>The Missionary of the Andes</i> (1815), and he also enjoyed considerable
reputation as an antiquary, his principal work in that
department being <i>Hermes Britannicus</i> (1828). In 1807 he <i>pub.</i> a
<i>Life of Pope</i>, in the preface to which he expressed some views on
poetry which resulted in a rather fierce controversy with Byron,
Campbell, and others. He also wrote a <i>Life of Bishop Ken</i>. B. was
an amiable, absent-minded, and rather eccentric man. His poems
are characterised by refinement of feeling, tenderness, and pensive
thought, but are deficient in power and passion.</p>

commercial position; was an M.P. 1835-37 and 1841-49, and held
various appointments in China. His chief literary work was the

pursued his studies on the Continent. On his return to England he
<a name='Page_45'></a>devoted himself to the study of science, especially natural philosophy
and chemistry. He was one of the founders of the Royal
Society, and, by his experiments and observations added to existing
knowledge, especially in regard to pneumatics. He at the same
time devoted much study to theology; so much indeed that he was
strongly urged by Lord Clarendon to enter the Church. Thinking,
however, that he could serve the cause of religion better as a layman,
he declined this advice. As a director of the East India Co. he did
much for the propagation of Christianity in the East, and for the
dissemination of the Bible. He also founded the &quot;Boyle Lectures&quot;
in defence of Christianity. He declined the offer of a peerage. B.

of his day, especially in the department of optics, in which he
made many discoveries. He maintained his habits of investigation
and composition to the very end of his long life, during which he
received almost every kind of honorary distinction open to a man of

to Sir W. Scott, and he also edited, in addition to various scientific

habits who embittered the lives of his children by his peculiar
theories of education. Brought up in a small parsonage close to the
graveyard of a bleak, windswept village on the Yorkshire moors,
and left motherless in early childhood, she was &quot;the motherly friend
and guardian of her younger sisters,&quot; of whom two, Emily and
Anne, shared, but in a less degree, her talents. After various
efforts as schoolmistresses and governesses, the sisters took to literature
and <i>pub.</i> a vol. of poems under the names of Currer, Ellis, and
Acton Bell, which, however, fell flat. Charlotte then wrote her first
novel, <i>The Professor</i>, which did not appear until after her death, and
began <i>Jane Eyre</i>, which, appearing in 1847, took the public by
storm. It was followed by <i>Shirley</i> in 1849, and <i>Villette</i> in 1852. In

was the authoress of <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> and <i>Agnes
Grey</i> (1848). She had not the intellectual force of her sisters. The
novels of Charlotte especially created a strong impression from the
first, and the <i>pub.</i> of <i>Jane Eyre</i> gave rise to much curiosity and
speculation as to its authorship. Their strength and originality
have retained for them a high place in English fiction which is likely
to prove permanent. There is a biography of Charlotte by <a href='#GASKELL_ELIZABETH_CLEGHORN_STEVENSON_1810_1865'>Mrs.

Exchequer (1614-21). In the latter year he was created a peer. He
was murdered by a servant. His works, which were chiefly <i>pub.</i>
after his death, consist of tragedies and sonnets, and poems on
political and moral subjects, including <i>C&aelig;lica</i> (109 sonnets). He
also wrote a Life of Sir P. Sidney, whose friend he was. His style
is grave and sententious. He is buried in the church at Warwick,
and the inscription on his tomb, written by himself, is a compendious
biography. It runs: &quot;Fulke Greville, servant to Queen Elizabeth,
counsellor to King James, friend to Sir Philip Sidney.&quot;</p><br />

as a career. He wrote poems, dramas, and novels; but the only
work which has kept its place is <i>The Fool of Quality</i> (5 vols. 1766-70),
<a name='Page_48'></a>which was a favourite book with John Wesley. His now forgotten
poem, <i>Universal Beauty</i> (1735) was admired by Pope. His <i>dau.</i>,

prose along with others, and was employed by Pope, whom he excelled
as a Greek scholar, in translating the <i>Odyssey</i>, of which he
Englished the 8th, 11th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 23rd books, catching

<a name='BROUGHAM_AND_VAUX_HENRY_1ST_LORD_1778_1868'></a><p><b>BROUGHAM AND VAUX, HENRY, 1ST LORD (1778-1868).</b>
&mdash;<i>S.</i>
of Henry B. of Brougham Hall, Westmoreland, <i>b.</i> in Edin., and <i>ed.</i>
at the High School and Univ. there, where he distinguished himself
chiefly in mathematics. He chose a legal career, and was called
to the Scottish Bar in 1800, and to the English Bar in 1808. His
chief forensic display was his defence of Queen Caroline in 1822. In
1810 he entered Parliament, where his versatility and eloquence soon
raised him to a foremost place. The questions on which he chiefly
exerted himself were the slave trade, commercial, legal, and parliamentary
reform, and education, and in all of these he rendered
signal service. When, in 1830, the Whigs, with whom he had
always acted, attained power, B. was made Lord Chancellor; but
his arrogance, selfishness, and indiscretion rendered him a dangerous
and unreliable colleague, and he was never again admitted to office.
He turned fiercely against his former political associates, but continued
his efforts on behalf of reform in various directions. He
was one of the founders of London Univ. and of the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. In literature he has a place as one
of the original projectors of and most voluminous contributors to
<i>The Edinburgh Review</i>, and as the author of a prodigious number of
treatises on science, philosophy, and history, including <i>Dialogues on
Instinct</i>, Lives of Statesmen, Philosophers, and Men of Science of
<a name='Page_49'></a>the Time of George III., Natural Theology, etc., his last work being
an autobiography written in his 84th year, and <i>pub.</i> 1871. His
writings were far too numerous and far too diverse in subject to be
of permanent value. His fame now rests chiefly on his services to
political and specially to legal reform, and to the diffusion of useful
literature, which are his lasting monuments.</p><br />

with Byron, and accompanied him in his journeys in the Peninsula,
Greece, and Turkey, and acted as his &quot;best man.&quot; In 1816 he
was with him after his separation from his wife, and contributed
notes to the fourth canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>, which was dedicated to
him. On his return he threw himself into politics with great
energy as an advanced Radical, and wrote various pamphlets, for
one of which he was in 1819 imprisoned in Newgate. In the following
year he entered Parliament, sitting for Westminster. After the
attainment of power by the Whigs he held various offices, including
those of Sec. at War, Chief Sec. for Ireland, and Pres. of the Board
of Control. He <i>pub.</i> <i>Journey through Albania</i> (1813), <i>Historical
Illustrations of the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold</i> (1818), and <i>Recollections
of a Long Life</i> (1865), for private circulation, and he left in MS.

&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i>
in Philadelphia, belonged to a Quaker family, became a lawyer, but
exchanged law for literature, and has the distinction of being the
first American to adopt a purely literary career. He wrote several
novels, including <i>Wieland</i> (1798), <i>Ormond</i> (1799), <i>Arthur Mervyn</i>
(1800-1), and his last, <i>Jane Talbot</i> (1801). With a good deal of
crudeness and sentimentality he has occasional power, but dwells
too much on the horrible and repulsive, the result, perhaps, of the
morbidity produced by the ill-health from which he all his life
suffered.</p><br />

picture of the harder and less genial aspects of Scottish life and
character. It may be regarded as a useful supplement and corrective
to the more roseate presentations of the kail-yard school of

<i>B.</i> at Biggar, he was <i>ed.</i> at the High School and Univ. of Edin.,
where practically the whole of his uneventful life was spent as a
physician, and where he was revered and beloved in no common degree,
and he was the cherished friend of many of his most distinguished
contemporaries, including Thackeray. He wrote comparatively
<a name='Page_50'></a>little; but all he did write is good, some of it perfect, of its kind.
His essays, among which are <i>Rab and his Friends</i>, <i>Pet Marjorie</i>,
<i>Our Dogs</i>, <i>Minchmoor</i>, and <i>The Enterkine</i>, were collected along with
papers on art, and medical history and biography, in <i>Hor&aelig;
Subseciv&aelig;</i> (Leisure Hours), 3 vols. In the mingling of tenderness
and delicate humour he has much in common with Lamb; in his
insight into dog-nature he is unique. His later years were clouded
with occasional fits of depression.</p><br />

direction of literature and philosophy, he devoted himself to the
cultivation of these, and succeeded Dugald Stewart as Professor of
Moral Philosophy in the Univ. of Edin., in which position he had
remarkable popularity as a lecturer. His main contribution to
literature is his <i>Lectures</i>, <i>pub.</i> after his death. B. was a man of
attractive character and considerable talents, but as a philosopher

including a mastership at Clifton. His later years were spent in his
native island. He had a true lyrical gift, and much of his poetry
was written in Manx dialect. His poems include <i>Fo'c'sle Yarns</i>
(1881), <i>The Doctor</i> (1887), <i>The Manx Witch</i> (1889), and <i>Old John</i>

<a name='BROWNE_SIR_THOMAS_1605_1682'></a><p><b>BROWNE, SIR THOMAS (1605-1682).</b>
&mdash;Physician and miscellaneous

was <i>ed.</i> at Winchester and Oxf., after which he studied medicine
<a name='Page_51'></a>at various Continental univs., including Leyden, where he <i>grad.</i>
He ultimately settled and practised at Norwich. His first and
perhaps best known work, <i>Religio Medici</i> (the Religion of a Physician)
was <i>pub.</i> in 1642. Other books are <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica:
Enquiries into Vulgar Errors</i> (1646), <i>Hydriotaphia, or Urn-burial</i>
(1658); and <i>The Garden of Cyrus</i> in the same year. After his death
were <i>pub.</i> his <i>Letter to a Friend</i> and <i>Christian Morals</i>. B. is one of
the most original writers in the English language. Though by no
means free from credulity, and dealing largely with trivial subjects
of inquiry, the freshness and ingenuity of his mind invest everything
he touches with interest; while on more important subjects his
style, if frequently rugged and pedantic, often rises to the highest
pitch of grave and stately eloquence. In the Civil War he sided
with the King's party, and was knighted in 1671 on the occasion of
a Royal visit to Norwich. In character he was simple, cheerful, and
retiring. He has had a profound if indirect influence on succeeding
literature, mainly by impressing master-minds such as Lamb,
Coleridge, and Carlyle.</p>

<a name='BROWNE_WILLIAM_1590_1645'></a><p><b>BROWNE, WILLIAM (1590?-1645?).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Tavistock,
<i>ed.</i> at Oxf., after which he entered the Inner Temple. His poems,
which are mainly descriptive, are rich and flowing, and true to the
phenomena of nature, but deficient in interest. Influenced by
Spenser, he in turn had an influence upon such poets as Milton and
Keats. His chief works were <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i> (1613), and <i>The
Shepheard's Pipe</i> (1614).</p><br />

<a name='BROWNING_ELIZABETH_BARRETT_1806_1861'></a><p><b>BROWNING, ELIZABETH BARRETT (1806-1861).</b>
&mdash;Poetess,
was the <i>dau.</i> of Edward Barrett Moulton Barrett, who assumed the
last name on succeeding to the estates of his grandfather in Jamaica.
She was <i>b.</i> at Coxhoe Hall, Durham, but spent her youth at Hope
End, near Great Malvern. While still a child she showed her gift, and
her <i>f.</i> <i>pub.</i> 50 copies of a juvenile epic, on the Battle of Marathon.
She was <i>ed.</i> at home, but owed her profound knowledge of Greek
and much mental stimulus to her early friendship with the blind
scholar, Hugh Stuart Boyd, who was a neighbour. At the age of 15
she met with an injury to her spine which confined her to a recumbent
position for several years, and from the effects of which she
never fully recovered. In 1826 she <i>pub.</i> anonymously <i>An Essay on
Mind and Other Poems</i>. Shortly afterwards the abolition of slavery,
of which he had been a disinterested supporter, considerably reduced
Mr. B.'s means: he accordingly disposed of his estate and
removed with his family first to Sidmouth and afterwards to London.
At the former Miss B. wrote <i>Prometheus Bound</i> (1835). After her
removal to London she fell into delicate health, her lungs being
threatened. This did not, however, interfere with her literary
labours, and she contributed to various periodicals <i>The Romaunt of
Margaret</i>, <i>The Romaunt of the Page</i>, <i>The Poet's Vow</i>, and other pieces.
In 1838 appeared <i>The Seraphim and Other Poems</i> (including &quot;Cowper's
Grave.&quot;) Shortly thereafter the death, by drowning, of her
favourite brother gave a serious shock to her already fragile health,
<a name='Page_52'></a>and for a time she hovered between life and death. Eventually,
however, she regained strength, and meanwhile her fame was growing.
The <i>pub.</i> about 1841 of <i>The Cry of the Children</i> gave it a great
impulse, and about the same time she contributed some critical
papers in prose to R.H. Horne's <i>New Spirit of the Age</i>. In 1844 she
<i>pub.</i> two vols. of <i>Poems</i>, which comprised &quot;The Drama of Exile,&quot;
&quot;Vision of Poets,&quot; and &quot;Lady Geraldine's Courtship.&quot; In 1845 she
met for the first time her future husband, <a href='#BROWNING_ROBERT_1812_1889'>Robert Browning</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).
Their courtship and marriage, owing to her delicate health and the
extraordinary objections entertained by Mr. B. to the marriage of
any of his children, were carried out under somewhat peculiar and
romantic circumstances. After a private marriage and a secret
departure from her home, she accompanied her husband to Italy,
which became her home almost continuously until her death, and
with the political aspirations of which she and her husband both
thoroughly identified themselves. The union proved one of unalloyed
happiness to both, though it was never forgiven by Mr.
Barrett. In her new circumstances her strength greatly increased.
Her husband and she settled in Florence, and there she wrote <i>Casa
Guidi Windows</i> (1851)&mdash;by many considered her strongest work&mdash;under
the inspiration of the Tuscan struggle for liberty. <i>Aurora
Leigh</i>, her largest, and perhaps the most popular of her longer
poems, appeared in 1856. In 1850 <i>The Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>&mdash;the
history of her own love-story, thinly disguised by its title&mdash;had
appeared. In 1860 she issued a <i>coll.</i> ed. of her poems under
the title, <i>Poems before Congress</i>. Soon thereafter her health underwent
a change for the worse; she gradually lost strength, and <i>d.</i> on
June 29, 1861. She is generally considered the greatest of English
poetesses. Her works are full of tender and delicate, but also of
strong and deep, thought. Her own sufferings, combined with her
moral and intellectual strength, made her the champion of the
suffering and oppressed wherever she found them. Her gift was
essentially lyrical, though much of her work was not so in form.
Her weak points are the lack of compression, an occasional somewhat
obtrusive mannerism, and frequent failure both in metre and
rhyme. Though not nearly the equal of her husband in force of
intellect and the higher qualities of the poet, her works had, as
might be expected on a comparison of their respective subjects and
styles, a much earlier and wider acceptance with the general public.
Mrs. B. was a woman of singular nobility and charm, and though
not beautiful, was remarkably attractive. <a href='#MITFORD_MARY_RUSSELL_1787_1855'>Miss Mitford</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) thus
describes her as a young woman: &quot;A slight, delicate figure, with a
shower of dark curls falling on each side of a most expressive face;
large, tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, and a smile
like a sunbeam.&quot;</p>

<a name='BROWNING_ROBERT_1812_1889'></a><p><b>BROWNING, ROBERT (1812-1889).</b>
&mdash;Poet, only <i>s.</i> of
Robert B., a man of fine intellect and equally fine character, who
held a position in the Bank of England, was <i>b.</i> in Camberwell. His
mother, to whom he was ardently attached, was the <i>dau.</i> of a German
shipowner who had settled in Dundee, and was alike intellectually
<a name='Page_53'></a>and morally worthy of his affection. The only other member of the
family was a younger sister, also highly gifted, who was the sympathetic
companion of his later years. In his childhood he was
distinguished by his love of poetry and natural history. At 12 he
had written a book of poetry which he destroyed when he could not
find a publisher. After being at one or two private schools, and
showing an insuperable dislike to school life, he was <i>ed.</i> by a tutor,
and thereafter studied Greek at Univ. Coll., London. Through
his mother he inherited some musical talent, and composed settings,
for various songs. His first <i>pub.</i> was <i>Pauline</i>, which appeared
anonymously in 1833, but attracted little attention. In 1834 he
paid his first visit to Italy, in which so much of his future life was to
be passed. The publication of <i>Paracelsus</i> in 1835, though the poem
had no general popularity, gained the notice of Carlyle, Wordsworth,
and other men of letters, and gave him a reputation as a poet of
distinguished promise. Two years later his drama of <i>Stratford</i> was
performed by his friend Macready and Helen Faucit, and in 1840 the
most difficult and obscure of his works, <i>Sordello</i>, appeared; but,
except with a select few, did little to increase his reputation. It
was followed by <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> (containing <i>Pippa Passes</i>)
(1841), <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i> (drama) (1843), <i>Luria</i> and <i>A Soul's
Tragedy</i> (1846). In this year he married <a href='#BROWNING_ELIZABETH_BARRETT_1806_1861'>Miss Elizabeth Barrett</a>
(<i>q.v.</i>), the poetess, a union of ideal happiness. Thereafter his home
until his wife's death in 1861 was in Italy, chiefly at Florence. In
1850 he wrote <i>Christmas Eve and Easter Day</i>, and in 1855 appeared
<i>Men and Women</i>. After the death of Mrs. Browning he returned to
England, paying, however, frequent visits to Italy. Settling in
London he published successively <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> (1864), <i>The Ring
and the Book</i> (1868-69), his greatest work, <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i>,
and <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> (1871), <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> (1872),
<i>Red Cotton Night-cap Country</i> (1873), <i>The Inn Album</i> (1875), <i>Pacchiarotto</i>
(1876), translation of <i>Agamemnon</i> (1879), <i>La Saisiaz</i>, etc.
(1878), <i>Dramatic Idylls</i> (1879 and 1880), <i>Asolando</i> (1889) appeared
on the day of his death. To the great majority of readers, probably,
B. is best known by some of his short poems, such as, to name a few,
&quot;Rabbi Ben Ezra,&quot; &quot;How they brought the good News to Aix,&quot;
&quot;Evelyn Hope,&quot; &quot;The Pied Piper of Hammelin,&quot; &quot;A Grammarian's
Funeral,&quot; &quot;A Death in the Desert.&quot; It was long before
England recognised that in B. she had received one of the greatest of
her poets, and the causes of this lie on the surface. His subjects
were often recondite and lay beyond the ken and sympathy of the
great bulk of readers; and owing, partly to the subtle links connecting
the ideas and partly to his often extremely condensed and rugged
expression, the treatment of them was not seldom difficult and
obscure. Consequently for long he appealed to a somewhat narrow
circle. As time went on, however, and work after work was added,
the circle widened, and the marvellous depth and variety of thought
and intensity of feeling told with increasing force. Societies began
to be formed for the study of the poet's work. Critics became more
and more appreciative, and he at last reaped the harvest of admiration
and honour which was his due. Many distinctions came to him.
He was made LL.D. of Edin., a life Governor of London Univ., and
had the offer of the Lord Rectorship of Glasgow. He <i>d.</i> in the house
<a name='Page_54'></a>of his son at Venice, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The
keynote of his teaching is a wise and noble optimism. His poems
were collected in 2 vols. in 1896. Some vols. of his correspondence
with Mrs. B. were also <i>pub.</i></p>

<p>Uniform ed. of Works (17 vols. 1888-90); Furnivall's <i>Browning

Abyssinia, and in 1770 reached the source of the Blue Nile. He
returned to England in 1774, and in 1790 <i>pub.</i> his <i>Travels</i> in 5
quarto vols. His notorious vanity, the singular adventures he
related, and the generally embellished character which he imparted
to his narrative excited some degree of scepticism, and he was subjected
to a good deal of satire, to which, though much annoyed, he
did not reply. It is, however, generally allowed that he had shown
great daring, perseverance, and zeal in his explorations, and that he

promising career was cut short by consumption in 1767. The
authorship of the beautiful <i>Ode to the Cuckoo</i> beginning &quot;Hail,

&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i> at
Cummington, Massachusetts, the <i>s.</i> of a doctor. His ancestors on
both sides came over in the <i>Mayflower</i>. His first poem was <i>Thanatopsis</i>
(1817), which was greeted as the best poem produced in
America up to that time. After being a lawyer for some time he
was induced to exchange law for journalism, and acted as ed. of
various periodicals. Among his best known poems are <i>Lines to a
Water-fowl</i>, <i>The Rivulet</i>, <i>The West Wind</i>, <i>The Forest Hymn</i>, <i>The
Fringed Gentian</i>, etc. His muse is tender and graceful, pervaded by
a contemplative melancholy, and a love of solitude and the silence
of the woods. Though he was brought up to admire Pope, and in
his early youth imitated him, he was one of the first American poets
to throw off his influence. He had a high sense of duty, was a
prominent and patriotic citizen, and enjoyed the esteem and even
the reverence of his fellow-countrymen. B. also produced a blank-verse
translation of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p><br />

<a name='BUCHANAN_GEORGE_1506_1582'></a><p><b>BUCHANAN, GEORGE (1506-1582).</b>
&mdash;Historian and scholar
<i>b.</i> at Killearn, Stirlingshire, of poor parents, was sent in 1519, with
the help of an uncle, to the Univ. of Paris, where he first came
in contact with the two great influences of the age, the Renaissance
and the Reformation. His uncle having died, he had to leave
Paris, and after seeing some military service, returned to Scotland,
and in 1524 went to St. Andrews, where he studied under <a href='#MAIR_or_MAJOR_JOHN_1469_1550'>John
Major</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). Two years later he found means to return to Paris,
where he graduated at the Scots Coll. in 1528, and taught grammar
in the Coll. of St. Barbe. Returning to Scotland in 1536 with a
great reputation for learning he was made by James V. tutor to one
of his illegitimate sons, and incited by him to satirise the vices of the
clergy, which he did in two Latin poems, <i>Somnium</i> and <i>Franciscanus</i>.
This stirred the wrath of the ecclesiastical powers to such a heat
that, the King withholding his protection, he was obliged in 1539 to
save himself by flight first to England and then to France, where he
remained until 1547 teaching Latin at Bordeaux and Paris. In the
latter year he was invited to become a prof. at Coimbra, where
he was imprisoned by the Inquisition as a heretic from 1549-51, and
wrote the greater part of his magnificent translation of the Psalms
into Latin verse, which has never been excelled by any modern.
He returned to England in 1552, but soon re-crossed to France and
taught in the Coll. of Boncourt. In 1561 he came back to his native
country, where he remained for the rest of his life. Hitherto, though
a supporter of the new learning and a merciless exposer of the vices
of the clergy, he had remained in the ancient faith, but he now
openly joined the ranks of the Reformers. He held the Principalship
<a name='Page_56'></a>of St. Leonard's Coll., St. Andrews, was a supporter of the party
of the Regent Moray, produced in 1571 his famous <i>Detectio Mari&aelig;
Regin&aelig;</i>, a scathing exposure of the Queen's relations to Darnley and
the circumstances leading up to his death, was tutor, 1570-78, to
James VI., whom he brought up with great strictness, and to whom
he imparted the learning of which the King was afterwards so vain.
His chief remaining works were <i>De Jure Regni apud Scotos</i> (1579),
against absolutism, and his <i>History of Scotland</i>, which was <i>pub.</i>
immediately before his death. Though he had borne so great a part
in the affairs of his country, and was the first scholar of his age, he
<i>d.</i> so poor that he left no funds to meet the expenses of his interment.
His literary masterpiece is his <i>History</i>, which is remarkable for the
power and richness of its style. Its matter, however, gave so much
offence that a proclamation was issued calling in all copies of it, as
well as of the <i>De Jure Regni</i>, that they might be purged of the
&quot;offensive and extraordinary matters&quot; which they contained. B.
holds his great and unique place in literature not so much for his
own writings as for his strong and lasting influence on subsequent
writers.</p><br />

<a name='BUCHANAN_ROBERT_1841_1901'></a><p><b>BUCHANAN, ROBERT (1841-1901).</b>
&mdash;Poet and novelist, <i>b.</i>
at Caverswall, Staffordshire, the <i>s.</i> of a Scottish schoolmaster and
socialist, and <i>ed.</i> at Glasgow, was the friend of <a href='#GRAY_DAVID_1838_1861'>David Gray</a> (<i>q.v.</i>),
and with him went to London in search of fame, but had a long
period of discouragement. His first work, a collection of poems,
<i>Undertones</i> (1863), had, however, some success, and was followed by
<i>Idylls of Inverburn</i> (1865), <i>London Poems</i> (1866), and others, which
gave him a growing reputation, and raised high hopes of his future.
Thereafter he took up prose fiction and the drama, not always with
success, and got into trouble owing to some drastic criticism of his
contemporaries, culminating in his famous article on the <i>Fleshly
School of Poetry</i>, which appeared in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> (Oct.
1871), and evoked replies from Rossetti (<i>The Stealthy School of Criticism</i>),
and Swinburne (<i>Under the Microscope</i>). Among his novels are
<i>A Child of Nature</i> (1879), <i>God and the Man</i> (1881), and among his
dramas <i>A Nine Days' Queen</i>, <i>A Madcap Prince</i>, and <i>Alone in London</i>.
His latest poems, <i>The Outcast</i> and <i>The Wandering Jew</i>, were directed
against certain aspects of Christianity. B. was unfortunate in his
latter years; a speculation turned out ruinously; he had to sell his
copyrights, and he sustained a paralytic seizure, from the effects of
which he <i>d.</i> in a few months. He ultimately admitted that his
criticism of Rossetti was unjustifiable.</p><br />

he again squandered by a life of wild extravagance and profligacy
at Court. He was a member of the &quot;Cabal&quot; and intrigued against
Clarendon. He wrote pamphlets, lampoons, and plays, but his
chief contribution to literature was <i>The Rehearsal</i>, a comedy, in
which he satirised the heroic drama of Dryden and others. It is

high degree of education privately, and inheriting an ample fortune
and a large library, he devoted himself to travel and study, with
the view of preparing for a great work which he had projected, <i>The
History of Civilisation in England</i>. As an introduction to this he
entered upon the consideration of the state of civilisation in various
other countries, but this he had scarcely completed when his death
took place at Damascus in 1862. The first vol. was <i>pub.</i> in 1857,
and the second in 1861. In these the results of a vast amount of
reading are shown; but they are not free from one-sided views and
generalisations resting on insufficient data. He has, however, the
credit of having contributed a new idea of history and the method
of writing it. The completed work was to have extended to 14 vols.

was a strong Royalist, and was privy to a scheme for bringing back
the Royal family. After the Restoration he obtained further preferment,
and became in 1704 Bishop of St. David's at an age when
his strength had become unequal to any very active discharge of the
duties of his see. He has a high place among Anglican theologians,
and as a defender of the doctrine of the Trinity was held in high
esteem even by Continental Romanist controversialists. Among
his works are <i>Harmonia Apostolica</i> (1669-70) in which he endeavoured
to reconcile alleged discrepancies between the teaching of
St. Paul and St. James on the relation between faith and works, in
which he assigned to the latter the higher authority, <i>Defensio

&mdash;<i>B.</i> at Elstow, near Bedford,
the <i>s.</i> of a poor tinker, was <i>ed.</i> at a free school, after which he
worked at his father's trade. At 17 he was drafted as a soldier in
the Civil War, and served for two years at Newport Pagnell. At
19 he <i>m.</i> a pious young woman, whose only dowry appears to have
been two books, the <i>Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven</i> and the
<i>Practice of Piety</i>, by which he was influenced towards a religious
life. In his autobiographical book, <i>Grace Abounding</i>, B. describes
himself as having led an abandoned life in his youth; but there
appears to be no evidence that he was, outwardly at any rate, worse
than the average of his neighbours: the only serious fault which he
specifies is profanity, others being dancing and bell-ringing. The
overwhelming power of his imagination led him to contemplate acts
of impiety and profanity, and to a vivid realisation of the dangers
these involved. In particular he was harassed by a curiosity in
regard to the &quot;unpardonable sin,&quot; and a prepossession that he had
already committed it. He continually heard voices urging him to
&quot;sell Christ,&quot; and was tortured by fearful visions. After severe
spiritual conflicts he escaped from this condition, and became an
enthusiastic and assured believer. In 1657 he joined the Baptist
Church, began to preach, and in 1660 was committed to Bedford Jail,
at first for three months, but on his refusing to conform, or to desist
from preaching, his confinement was extended with little interval for
a period of nearly 12 years, not always, however, very rigorous. He
supported his family (wife and four children, including a blind girl)
by making tagged laces, and devoted all the time he could spare
from this to studying his few books and writing. During this
period he wrote among other things, <i>The Holy City</i> and <i>Grace
Abounding</i>. Under the Declaration of Indulgence he was released
in 1672, and became a licensed preacher. In 1675 the Declaration
was cancelled, and he was, under the Conventicle Act, again imprisoned
for six months, during which he wrote the first part of <i>The
Pilgrim's Progress</i>, which appeared in 1678, and to which considerable
additions were made in subsequent editions. It was followed
by the <i>Life and Death of Mr. Badman</i> (1680), <i>The Holy War</i> (1682),
<a name='Page_59'></a>and the second part of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i> (1684). B. was now
widely known as a popular preacher and author, and exercised a
wide influence. In 1688 he set out on a journey to mediate between
a father and son, in which he was successful. On the return journey
he was drenched with rain, caught a chill and <i>d.</i> in London on
August 31. He is buried in Bunhill Fields. B. has the distinction
of having written, in <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, probably the most
widely read book in the English language, and one which has been
translated into more tongues than any book except the Bible.
The charm of the work, which makes it the joy of old and young,
learned and ignorant, and of readers of all possible schools of thought
and theology, lies in the interest of a story in which the intense
imagination of the writer makes characters, incidents, and scenes
alike live in that of his readers as things actually known and remembered
by themselves, in its touches of tenderness and quaint
humour, its bursts of heart-moving eloquence, and its pure, nervous,
idiomatic English, Macaulay has said, &quot;Every reader knows the
straight and narrow path as well as he knows a road on which he has
been backwards and forwards a hundred times,&quot; and he adds that
&quot;In England during the latter half of the seventeenth century there
were only two minds which possessed the imaginative faculty in a
very eminent degree. One of these minds produced the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, the other <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>.&quot; B. wrote about 60 books
and tracts, of which <i>The Holy War</i> ranks next to <i>The Pilgrim's
Progress</i> in popularity, while <i>Grace Abounding</i> is one of the most
interesting pieces of biography in existence.</p>

<a name='BURKE_EDMUND_1729_1797'></a><p><b>BURKE, EDMUND (1729-1797).</b>
&mdash;Statesman, orator, and
political philosopher, was the <i>s.</i> of an attorney in Dublin, where he
was <i>b.</i> His <i>f.</i> was a Protestant, but his mother, whose maiden name
was Nagle, was a Roman Catholic. He received his early <i>ed.</i> at a
Quaker school at Ballitore, and in 1743 proceeded to Trinity Coll.,
Dublin, where he graduated in 1748. His <i>f.</i> wished him to study for
the law, and with this object he, in 1750, went to London and entered
the Middle Temple. He, however, disliked law and spent more time
in literary pursuits than in legal study. In 1756 his first <i>pub.</i> work
appeared, <i>A Vindication of Natural Society</i>, a satire on the views of
Bolingbroke, but so close was the imitation of that writer's style,
and so grave the irony, that its point as a satire was largely missed.<a name='Page_60'></a>
In the same year he <i>pub.</i> his famous treatise <i>On the Sublime and
Beautiful</i>, which attracted universal attention, and three years
later (1759) he projected with Dodsley the publisher <i>The Annual
Register</i>, for which he continued to write the yearly Survey of
Events until 1788. About the same time he was introduced to
W.G. Hamilton (known as Single-speech H.) then about to go to
Ireland as Chief Sec., and accompanied him in the capacity of
private sec., in which he remained for three years. In 1765 he
became private sec. to the Marquis of Rockingham, the Whig statesman,
then Prime Minister, who became his fast friend until his death.
At the same time he entered Parliament as member for Wendover,
and began his brilliant career as an orator and philosophic
statesman. The first great subject in which he interested himself
was the controversy with the American colonies, which soon developed
into war and ultimate separation, and in 1769 he <i>pub.</i>, in
reply to G. Grenville, his pamphlet on <i>The Present State of the
Nation</i>. In the same year he purchased the small estate of Gregories
near Beaconsfield. His speeches and writings had now made him
famous, and among other effects had brought about the suggestion
that he was the author of the <i>Letters of Junius</i>. It was also about this
time that he became one of the circle which, including Goldsmith,
Garrick, etc., had Johnson for its central luminary. In 1770 appeared
<i>Thoughts on the Causes of the Present Discontent</i>, directed
against the growth of the Royal power on the one hand, and of
faction on the other. In 1774 he was elected member for Bristol,
and continued so until 1780, when differences with his constituency
on the questions of Irish trade and Catholic emancipation led to his
resignation, after which he sat for Malton until his final retirement
from public life. Under the administration of Lord North (1770-1782)
the American war went on from bad to worse, and it was in part
owing to the splendid oratorical efforts of B. that it was at last
brought to an end. To this period belong two of his most brilliant
performances, his speech on <i>Conciliation with America</i> (1775), and
his <i>Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol</i> (1777). The fall of North led to
Rockingham being recalled to power, which, however, he held for a
few months only, dying in the end of 1782, during which period B.
held the office of Paymaster of the Forces, and was made a Privy
Councillor. Thereafter he committed the great error of his political
life in supporting Fox in his coalition with North, one of the most
flagitious, as it was to those concerned in it, one of the most fatal,
political acts in our parliamentary history. Under this unhappy
combination he continued to hold during its brief existence the
office of Paymaster, and distinguished himself in connection with
Fox's India Bill. The coalition fell in 1783, and was succeeded by
the long administration of Pitt, which lasted until 1801. B. was
accordingly for the remainder of his political life in opposition. In
1785 he made his great speech on <i>The Nabob of Arcot's Debts</i>, and in
the next year (1786) he moved for papers in regard to the Indian
government of Warren Hastings, the consequence of which was the
impeachment of that statesman, which, beginning in 1787, lasted
until 1794, and of which B. was the leading promoter. Meanwhile,
the events in France were in progress which led to the Revolution,
and culminated in the death of the King and Queen. By these B.<a name='Page_61'></a>
was profoundly moved, and his <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i>
(1790) electrified England, and even Europe. Its success was
enormous. The same events and the differences which arose
regarding them in the Whig party led to its break up, to the
rupture of B's friendship with Fox, and to his <i>Appeal from the New
to the Old Whigs</i>. In 1794 a terrible blow fell upon him in the loss
of his son Richard, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom
he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others, and which
in fact appear to have been non-existent. In the same year the
Hastings trial came to an end. B. felt that his work was done and
indeed that he was worn out; and he took leave of Parliament.
The King, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French
Revolution, wished to make him Lord Beaconsfield, but the death
of his son had deprived such an honour of all its attractions, and
the only reward he would accept was a pension of &pound;2500. Even
this modest reward for services so transcendent was attacked by
the Duke of Bedford, to whom B. made a crushing reply in the
<i>Letter to a Noble Lord</i> (1796). His last <i>pub.</i> was the <i>Letter on a
Regicide Peace</i> (1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with
France. When it appeared the author was dead.</p>

<p>B. was one of the greatest political thinkers whom England has
produced, and all his writings, like his speeches, are characterised
by the welding together of knowledge, thought, and feeling. Unlike
most orators he is more successful as a writer than as a speaker.
He rose too far above the heads of his audience, which the continued
splendour of his declamation, his inordinate copiousness, and his
excessive vehemence, often passing into fury, at length wearied, and
even disgusted: but in his writings are found some of the grandest
examples of a fervid and richly elaborated eloquence. Though he
was never admitted to the Cabinet, he guided and influenced largely
the policy of his party, while by his efforts in the direction of
economy and order in administration at home, and on behalf of
kindly and just government in India, as well as by his contributions
to political philosophy, he laid his country and indeed the world
under lasting obligations.</p>

take an active part in the controversies of the time, and he endeavoured
to bring about a reconciliation between Episcopacy and
Presbytery. Going to London he was in some favour with Charles
II., from whom he received various preferments. His literary reputation
was greatly enhanced by the publication in 1679 of the first
vol. of his <i>History of the Reformation of the Church of England</i>, for
which he received the thanks of Parliament, and which was completed
by other two vols., in 1682 and 1714. On account of a letter
of reproof which he ventured to write to the King, he lost favour at
Court, and the policy pursued by James II. being very repugnant to
him, he betook himself in 1687 to Holland, where he became one of
the advisers of the Prince of Orange. Returning to England at the
Revolution, he was made Bishop of Salisbury, which office he
adorned by liberal views and a zealous discharge of duty. The work
by which his fame is chiefly sustained, his <i>History of my Own Times</i>,
was, by his direction, not to be <i>pub.</i> until 6 years after his death. It
appeared in 1723. It gives a sketch of the history of the Civil Wars
and Commonwealth, and a detailed account of the immediately succeeding
period down to 1713. While not free from egotism and some
party feeling, it is written with a sincere desire for accuracy and fairness,
and it has largely the authority of an eye-witness. The style, if
somewhat lacking in dignity, is lively and picturesque. Among his
other writings are a <i>History of the Dukes of Hamilton</i>, and an <i>Exposition
of the 39 Articles</i>.</p>

&mdash;Theologian and
writer on cosmogony, was <i>b.</i> at Croft near Darlington, and <i>ed.</i> at
Camb., and became Master of Charterhouse and Clerk of the Closet to
William III. His literary fame rests on his <i>Telluris Theoria Sacra,
or Sacred Theory of the Earth</i>, <i>pub.</i> about 1692, first in Latin and
afterwards in English, a work which, in absence of all scientific
knowledge of the earth's structure, was necessarily a mere speculative
cosmogony. It is written, however, with much eloquence.
Some of the views expressed in another work, <i>Arch&aelig;olgi&aelig; Philosophic&aelig;</i>,
were, however, so unacceptable to contemporary theologians
that he had to resign his post at Court.</p><br />

<a name='BURNS_ROBERT_1759_1796'></a><p><b>BURNS, ROBERT (1759-1796).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i> near Ayr, the
<i>s.</i> of William Burness or Burns, a small farmer, and a man of considerable
force of character and self-culture. His youth was passed
in poverty, hardship, and a degree of severe manual labour which
left its traces in a premature stoop and weakened constitution. He
had little regular schooling, and got much of what education he had
from his father, who taught his children reading, writing, arithmetic,
geography, and history, and also wrote for them &quot;A Manual of
Christian Belief.&quot; With all his ability and character, however, the
elder B. was consistently unfortunate, and migrated with his large
family from farm to farm without ever being able to improve his
circumstances. In 1781 Robert went to Irvine to become a flax-dresser,
but, as the result of a New Year carousal of the workmen,
<a name='Page_63'></a>including himself, the shop took fire and was burned to the ground.
This venture accordingly came to an end. In 1784 the <i>f.</i> died, and
B. with his brother Gilbert made an ineffectual struggle to keep on
the farm; failing in which they removed to Mossgiel, where they
maintained an uphill fight for 4 years. Meanwhile, his love affair
with Jean Armour had passed through its first stage, and the
troubles in connection therewith, combined with the want of
success in farming, led him to think of going to Jamaica as bookkeeper
on a plantation. From this he was dissuaded by a letter
from <a href='#BLACKLOCK_THOMAS_1721_1791'>Dr. Thomas Blacklock</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and at the suggestion of his
brother <i>pub.</i> his poems. This first ed. was brought out at Kilmarnock
in June 1786, and contained much of his best work, including
&quot;The Twa Dogs,&quot; &quot;The Address to the Deil,&quot; &quot;Hallowe'en,&quot;
&quot;The Cottar's Saturday Night,&quot; &quot;The Mouse,&quot; &quot;The Daisy,&quot;
etc., many of which had been written at Mossgiel. Copies of this ed.
are now extremely scarce, and as much as &pound;550 has been paid for one.
The success of the work was immediate, the poet's name rang over
all Scotland, and he was induced to go to Edin. to superintend the
issue of a new ed. There he was received as an equal by the
brilliant circle of men of letters which the city then boasted&mdash;Dugald
Stewart, Robertson, Blair, etc., and was a guest at aristocratic
tables, where he bore himself with unaffected dignity. Here
also Scott, then a boy of 15, saw him and describes him as of
&quot;manners rustic, not clownish. His countenance ... more
massive than it looks in any of the portraits ... a strong expression
of shrewdness in his lineaments; the eye alone indicated the
poetical character and temperament. It was large, and of a dark
cast, and literally glowed when he spoke with feeling or interest.&quot;
The results of this visit outside of its immediate and practical object,
included some life-long friendships, among which were those with
Lord Glencairn and Mrs. Dunlop. The new ed. brought him
&pound;400. About this time the episode of Highland Mary occurred.
On his return to Ayrshire he renewed his relations with Jean Armour,
whom he ultimately married, took the farm of Ellisland near Dumfries,
having meanwhile taken lessons in the duties of an exciseman,
as a line to fall back upon should farming again prove unsuccessful.
At Ellisland his society was cultivated by the local gentry. And
this, together with literature and his duties in the excise, to which
he had been appointed in 1789, proved too much of a distraction to
admit of success on the farm, which in 1791 he gave up. Meanwhile
he was writing at his best, and in 1790 had produced <i>Tam o' Shanter</i>.
About this time he was offered and declined an appointment in
London on the staff of the <i>Star</i> newspaper, and refused to become
a candidate for a newly-created Chair of Agriculture in the Univ.
of Edin., although influential friends offered to support his claims.
After giving up his farm he removed to Dumfries. It was at this
time that, being requested to furnish words for <i>The Melodies of
Scotland</i>, he responded by contributing over 100 songs, on which
perhaps his claim to immortality chiefly rests, and which placed him
in the front rank of lyric poets. His worldly prospects were now
perhaps better than they had ever been; but he was entering upon
the last and darkest period of his career. He had become soured,
and moreover had alienated many of his best friends by too freely
<a name='Page_64'></a>expressing sympathy with the French Revolution, and the then
unpopular advocates of reform at home. His health began to give
way; he became prematurely old, and fell into fits of despondency;
and the habits of intemperance, to which he had always been more
or less addicted, grew upon him. He <i>d.</i> on July 21, 1797.</p>

<p>The genius of B. is marked by spontaneity, directness, and sincerity,
and his variety is marvellous, ranging from the tender intensity
of some of his lyrics through the rollicking humour and blazing
wit of <i>Tam o' Shanter</i> to the blistering satire of <i>Holy Willie's Prayer</i>
and <i>The Holy Fair</i>. His life is a tragedy, and his character full of
flaws. But he fought at tremendous odds, and as Carlyle in his
great Essay says, &quot;Granted the ship comes into harbour with
shrouds and tackle damaged, the pilot is blameworthy ... but
to know <i>how</i> blameworthy, tell us first whether his voyage has been
round the Globe or only to Ramsgate and the Isle of Dogs.&quot;</p>

<p>The books about Burns, his life and writings, are innumerable.
Among the Lives are those by Currie (1800); Allan Cunningham
(1834); J.G. Lockhart (1828), on which is based Carlyle's memorable
<i>Essay</i> (which <i><a href='#CARLYLE_THOMAS_1795_1881'>see</a></i>). Among the famous ed. of the <i>Poems</i> may
be mentioned the first (Kilmarnock 1786), Edin. (1787), and the
<i>Centenary</i> (1896), by W.E. Henley and T.F. Henderson.</p>

&mdash;Historian, was <i>b.</i> and
<i>ed.</i> at Aberdeen, was in 1831 called to the Bar, but had little practice,
and in 1854 was appointed Sec. to the Prison Board of Scotland,
and in 1877 a Commissioner of Prisons. He became at an early
period of his life a contributor to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> and other
periodicals, and in 1846 <i>pub.</i> a life of Hume, which attracted considerable
attention, and was followed by Lives of Lord Lovat and
Lord President Forbes. He began his career as an historian by the
publication in 1853 of <i>History of Scotland from the Revolution to the
Extinction of the last Jacobite Insurrection</i>, to which he added (1867-70)
<i>History of Scotland from Agricola's Invasion to the Revolution</i>, in
7 vols., thus completing a continuous narrative. Subsequently he
<i>pub.</i> a <i>History of the Reign of Queen Anne</i> (1880). Other works of a
lighter kind were <i>The Book-Hunter</i> (1862), and <i>The Scot Abroad</i>
(1864). B.'s historical works display much research and a spirit of
candour and honesty, and have picturesque and spirited passages,
but the style is unequal, and frequently lacks dignity. On the
whole, however, his is regarded as the most generally trustworthy
and valuable history of Scotland at present existing.</p><br />

&mdash;Explorer
and scholar, <i>s.</i> of an officer in the army, was <i>b.</i> at Barham House,
Herts, and after a somewhat desultory education abroad as well as
at home, entered upon a life of travel, adventure, and military and
civil service in almost every quarter of the world, including India,
Africa, the nearer East, and North and South America, in the course
of which he mastered 35 languages. As an official his masterful
<a name='Page_65'></a>ways and spirit of adventure frequently brought him into collision
with superior powers, by whom he not seldom considered himself
ill-used. He was the author of upwards of 50 books on a great
variety of subjects, including travels, novels, and translations,
among which are <i>Personal Narrative of a Journey to Mecca</i> (1855),
<i>First Footprints in East Africa</i> (1856), <i>Lake Regions of Equatorial
Africa</i> (1860), <i>The Nile Basin</i>, a translation and life of Camoens, an
absolutely literal translation of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, with notes and
commentaries, of which his accomplished wife <i>pub.</i> an expurgated
edition. Lady B., who was the companion of his travels after 1861,
also wrote books on Syria, Arabia, and other eastern countries, as

at Lindley, Leicestershire, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., took orders, and became
Vicar of St. Thomas, Oxf., 1616, and Rector of Segrave, Leicestershire,
1630. Subject to depression of spirits, he wrote as an antidote
the singular book which has given him fame. <i>The Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>, in which he appears under the name of <i>Democritus
Junior</i>, was <i>pub.</i> in 1621, and had great popularity. In the words
of Warton, &quot;The author's variety of learning, his quotations from
rare and curious books, his pedantry sparkling with rude wit and
shapeless elegance ... have rendered it a repertory of amusement
and information.&quot; It has also proved a store-house from which
later authors have not scrupled to draw without acknowledgment.
It was a favourite book of Dr. Johnson. B. was a mathematician
and dabbled in astrology. When not under depression he was an
amusing companion, &quot;very merry, facete, and juvenile,&quot; and a
person of &quot;great honesty, plain dealing, and charity.&quot;</p>

<i>Separation</i>, <i>The Divorced</i>, etc., but is chiefly remembered in connection
with a <i>Diary illustrative of the Times of George IV.</i> (1838),

ascribed to her. She also wrote some poems and two devotional

&mdash;Theologian, <i>b.</i> at Wantage,
<i>s.</i> of a Presbyterian linen-draper, was destined for the ministry
of that Church, but in 1714 he decided to enter the Church of<a name='Page_66'></a>
England, and went to Oxf. After holding various other preferments
he became rector of the rich living of Stanhope, Bishop of Bristol
(1738), and Bishop of Durham (1750), and was said to have refused
the Primacy. In 1726 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Fifteen Sermons</i>, and in 1736 <i>The
Analogy of Religion</i>. These two books are among the most powerful
and original contributions to ethics and theology which have ever
been made. They depend for their effect entirely upon the force of
their reasoning, for they have no graces of style. B. was an excellent
man, and a diligent and conscientious churchman. Though indifferent
to general literature, he had some taste in the fine arts,
especially architecture. B.'s works were ed. by W.E. Gladstone
(2 vols. 1896), and there are Lives by Bishop W. Fitzgerald, Spooner
(1902), and others, <i>see</i> also <i>History of English Thought in 18th

<a name='BUTLER_SAMUEL_1612_1680'></a><p><b>BUTLER, SAMUEL (1612-1680).</b>
&mdash;Satirist, was the <i>s.</i> of a
Worcestershire farmer. In early youth he was page to the Countess
of Kent, and thereafter clerk to various Puritan justices, some of
whom are believed to have suggested characters in <i>Hudibras</i>.
After the Restoration he became Sec. to the Lord Pres. of Wales, and
about the same time <i>m.</i> a Mrs. Herbert, a widow with a jointure,
which, however, was lost. In 1663 the first part of <i>Hudibras</i> was
<i>pub.</i>, and the other two in 1664 and 1668 respectively. This work,
which is to a certain extent modelled on <i>Don Quixote</i>, stands at the
head of the satirical literature of England, and for wit and compressed
thought has few rivals in any language. It is directed
against the Puritans, and while it holds up to ridicule the extravagancies
into which many of the party ran, it entirely fails to do justice
to their virtues and their services to liberty, civil and religious.
Many of its brilliant couplets have passed into the proverbial
commonplaces of the language, and few who use them have any idea
of their source. Butler, notwithstanding the popularity of his work,
was neglected by the Court, and <i>d.</i> in poverty.</p>

(nowhere) (1872), and <i>Erewhon Revisited</i> (1901). He translated the
<i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> in prose, and mooted the theory that the latter was
written by a woman. Other works were <i>The Fair Haven</i>, <i>Life and
Habit</i>, <i>The Way of all Flesh</i> (a novel) (1903), etc., and some sonnets.
He also wrote on the Sonnets of Shakespeare.</p><br />

<a name='BYRON_GEORGE_GORDON_6TH_LORD_BYRON_1788_1824'></a><p><b>BYRON, GEORGE GORDON, 6TH LORD BYRON (1788-1824).</b>
&mdash;Poet,
was <i>b.</i> in London, the <i>s.</i> of Captain John B. and of Catherine
Gordon, heiress of Gight, Aberdeenshire, his second wife, whom he
<i>m.</i> for her money and, after squandering it, deserted. He was also
the grand-nephew of the 5th, known as the &quot;wicked&quot; Lord B.
From his birth he suffered from a malformation of the feet, causing
a slight lameness, which was a cause of lifelong misery to him,
aggravated by the knowledge that with proper care it might have
been cured. After the departure of his <i>f.</i> his mother went to Aberdeen,
where she lived on a small salvage from her fortune. She was a
<a name='Page_67'></a>capricious woman of violent temper, with no fitness for guiding her
volcanic son, and altogether the circumstances of his early life
explain, if they do not excuse, the spirit of revolt which was his lifelong
characteristic. In 1794, on the death of a cousin, he became
heir-presumptive to the title and embarrassed estates of the family,
to which, on the death of his great-uncle in 1798, he succeeded. In
1801 he was sent to Harrow, where he remained until 1805, when
he proceeded to Trinity Coll., Camb., where he read much history
and fiction, lived extravagantly, and got into debt. Some early
verses which he had <i>pub.</i> in 1806 were suppressed. They were
followed in 1807 by <i>Hours of Idleness</i>, which was savagely attacked
in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. In reply he sent forth <i>English Bards and
Scotch Reviewers</i> (1800), which created considerable stir and shortly
went through 5 ed. Meanwhile, he had settled at Newstead
Abbey, the family seat, where with some of his cronies he was
believed to have indulged in wild and extravagant orgies, the
accounts of which, however, were probably greatly exaggerated.
In 1809 he left England, and passing through Spain, went to Greece.
During his absence, which extended over two years, he wrote the
first two cantos of <i>Childe Harold</i>, which were <i>pub.</i> after his return
in 1812, and were received with acclamation. In his own words,
&quot;he awoke one morning and found himself famous.&quot; He followed
up his success with some short poems, <i>The Corsair</i>, <i>Lara</i>, etc.
About the same time began his intimacy with his future biographer,
<a href='#MOORE_THOMAS_1779_1852'>Thomas Moore</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and about 1815 he married Anne Isabella
Milbanke, who had refused him in the previous year, a union which,
owing to the total incompatibility of the parties, and serious provocations
on the part of B., proved unhappy, and was in 1816 dissolved
by a formal deed of separation. The only fruit of it was a
<i>dau.</i>, Augusta Ada. After this break-up of his domestic life,
followed as it was by the severe censure of society, and by pressure
on the part of his creditors, which led to the sale of his library, B.
again left England, as it turned out, for ever, and, passing through
Belgium and up the Rhine, went to Geneva, afterwards travelling
with Shelley through Switzerland, when he wrote the third canto of
<i>Childe Harold</i>. He wintered in Venice, where he formed a connection
with Jane Clairmont, the <i>dau.</i> of <a href='#GODWIN_WILLIAM_1756_1836'>W. Godwin's</a> second wife
(<i>q.v.</i>). In 1817 he was in Rome, whence returning to Venice he
wrote the fourth canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>. In the same year he sold
his ancestral seat of Newstead, and about the same time <i>pub.</i> <i>Manfred</i>,
<i>Cain</i>, and <i>The Deformed Transformed</i>. The first five cantos of
<i>Don Juan</i> were written between 1818 and 1820, during which period
he made the acquaintance of the Countess Guiccioli, whom he
persuaded to leave her husband. It was about this time that he
received a visit from Moore, to whom he confided his MS. autobiography,
which Moore, in the exercise of the discretion left to him,
burned in 1824. His next move was to Ravenna, where he wrote
much, chiefly dramas, including <i>Marino Faliero</i>. In 1821-22 he
finished <i>Don Juan</i> at Pisa, and in the same year he joined with Leigh
Hunt in starting a short-lived newspaper, <i>The Liberal</i>, in the first
number of which appeared <i>The Vision of Judgment</i>. His last
Italian home was Genoa, where he was still accompanied by the
Countess, and where he lived until 1823, when he offered himself as
<a name='Page_68'></a>an ally to the Greek insurgents. In July of that year he started for
Greece, spent some months in Cephalonia waiting for the Greeks to
form some definite plans. In January, 1824, he landed at Missolonghi,
but caught a malarial fever, of which he <i>d.</i> on April 19, 1824.</p>

<p>The final position of B. in English literature is probably not yet
settled. It is at present undoubtedly lower than it was in his own
generation. Yet his energy, passion, and power of vivid and richly-coloured
description, together with the interest attaching to his wayward
and unhappy career, must always make him loom large in the
assembly of English writers. He exercised a marked influence on
Continental literature, and his reputation as poet is higher in some
foreign countries than in his own.</p>

<p>Among ed. of the works of B. may be mentioned Murray's (13
vols. 1898-1904). Moore's <i>Life</i> (1830), Lady Blessington's <i>Conversations

<a name='CAEDMON_d_1680'></a><p><b>C&AElig;DMON (<i>d.</i> 1680).</b>
&mdash;The first English poet of whom we
have any knowledge. Originally employed as cowherd at the Abbey
of Whitby, he became a singer when somewhat advanced in life.
The story of how the gift of song came to him is given by Bede, how
having fallen asleep in the stable he dreamed that one came to him
desiring a song, and on his asking &quot;What shall I sing?&quot; replied
&quot;Sing to me of the beginning of created things.&quot; Therefore he
began to sing and, on awaking, remembered his song and added to
it. Thereafter he told what had befallen him to the bailiff who
was over him, who repeated the tale to the Abbess Hilda. She
having called together certain learned and pious persons, C. was
brought before them, told his story, and recited his verses. A
part of Scripture was read to him, which he was asked to turn into
verse; and this being done he was received into the Abbey where,
for the rest of his life, he lived as a monk, and continued to make
his holy songs. Much that was formerly attributed to C. is now
held to be of later date. All that is known to be his is a Northumbrian
version of Bede's Latin paraphrases of C.'s first song: although
by some the authorship of &quot;The Dream of the Holy Rood,&quot; and of
a fragment on &quot;The Temptation and Fall of Man&quot; is claimed for
him.</p>

(1880), and a vol. on <i>Spinoza</i> (1888).</p><br />

<a name='CALAMY_EDMUND_1600_1666'></a><p><b>CALAMY, EDMUND (1600-1666).</b>
&mdash;Puritan Divine, <i>b.</i> in
London, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., was one of the principal authors of a
famous controversial work bearing the title <i>Smectymnuus</i>, made up of
the initials of the various writers, and <i>pub.</i> in 1641 in reply to Bishop
Hall's <i>Divine Right of Episcopacy</i>. His other chief work is <i>The
Godly Man's Ark</i>. A Presbyterian, he was a supporter of monarchy,
and favoured the Restoration, after which he was offered,
but declined, the see of Coventry and Lichfield. He was a member
of the Savoy Conference. The passing of the Act of Uniformity led
to his retiring from ministerial work. He is said to have <i>d.</i> of
melancholy caused by the great fire of London.</p><br />

&mdash;Scottish Church
historian, belonged to a good family, and about 1604 became minister
of Crailing, Roxburghshire. Opposing the designs of James VI. for
setting up Episcopacy, he was imprisoned 1617, and afterwards had
to betake himself to Holland, where his controversial work, <i>Altare
Damascenum</i>, against Episcopacy, was <i>pub.</i> In 1625 he returned
to Scotland, and began his great work, <i>The Historie of the Kirk of
Scotland</i>, which was <i>pub.</i> in an abridged form (1646). The complete
work was printed (1841-49) for the Woodrow Society. C. became
minister of Pencaitland, East Lothian, about 1640, and was one of

the Bar in 1865, and appeared to have a brilliant career before
him, when a fall on the ice in 1866 changed him from a distinguished

School, and Head Master in 1593, and spent his vacations in travelling
over England collecting antiquarian information. His great
work, <i>Britannia</i>, was <i>pub.</i> in 1586, and at once brought him fame
both at home and abroad. It is a work of vast labour and erudition,
written in elegant Latin. In 1597 C. was made Clarencieux King-at-Arms
which, setting him free from his academic duties, enabled
him to devote more time to his antiquarian and historical labours.
His other principal works are <i>Annals of the Reign of Elizabeth</i>
(printed 1615-1623), <i>Monuments and Inscriptions in Westminster
Abbey</i> (1600), and a <i>coll.</i> of <i>Ancient English Historians</i>. He was

of Solicitor and Attorney-General, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Lord
Chief Justice, and Lord Chancellor. His contributions to literature
were <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i> and <i>Lives of the Chief Justices</i>. These
works, though deficient in research and accuracy, often unfair in

<a name='CAMPBELL_THOMAS_1777_1844'></a><p><b>CAMPBELL, THOMAS (1777-1844).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was the youngest
<i>s.</i> of Alexander C., a merchant in Glasgow, where he was <i>b.</i> After
leaving the Univ. of that city, where he gained some distinction
by his translations from the Greek, and acting for some time as
<a name='Page_71'></a>a tutor, he went to Edin. to study law, in which, however, he
did not make much progress, but gained fame by producing in 1799,
at the age of 21, his principal poem, <i>The Pleasures of Hope</i>. In
spite of some of the faults of youth, the vigour of thought and description,
and power of versification displayed in the poem, as well
as its noble feeling for liberty, made it a marvellous performance for
so young a man. His other larger poems are <i>Gertrude of Wyoming</i>
(1809), <i>O'Connor's Child</i>, and <i>Theodric</i> (1824). It is not, however,
for these that he will be chiefly remembered, but for his patriotic
and war lyrics, <i>Ye Mariners of England</i>, <i>Hohenlinden</i>, and <i>The Battle
of the Baltic</i>, which are imperishable. C. was also distinguished as
a critic, and his <i>Specimens of the British Poets</i> (1819) is prefaced by an
essay which is an important contribution to criticism. C. resided
in London from 1803 until the year of his death, which took place at
Boulogne, whither he had repaired in search of health. In addition
to the works mentioned he wrote various compilations, including
<i>Annals of Great Britain</i>, covering part of the reign of George III.
In 1805 he received a Government pension, and he was Lord Rector
of Glasgow Univ. 1826-29. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

London. He wrote masques, and many fine lyrics remarkable for
their metrical beauty, of which &quot;Cherry Ripe&quot; and &quot;Lesbia&quot; are
well known. He also wrote <i>Epigrams</i> in Latin, and <i>Observations on

was brought up by an uncle, who sent him to Eton and Oxf. In
1793 he entered Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, and soon became
one of the most brilliant debaters in the House. After filling various
offices, including that of Foreign Sec., with striking ability, he
was in 1827 appointed Prime Minister, but <i>d.</i>, deeply mourned by
the nation, a few months later. He has a place in literature as the
leading spirit in the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>, a paper started during the French
Revolution, in support of the English Constitution, and which, with
Gifford for ed., had many of the most eminent men of the day as
contributors. C. wrote the <i>Needy Knife-grinder</i>, <i>The Loves of the

and was a client of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, whose life he
wrote. He was the author of numerous theological and historical
works, some of which are of considerable importance, including in
Latin, <i>Nova Legenda Angli&aelig;</i>, <i>De Illustribus Henricis</i>: lives of German
Emperors, English Kings, etc., of the name of Henry, and in English,

of the first and best of the courtly poets who wrote gracefully on
light themes of Court life and gallantry. C.'s poems have often
much beauty and even tenderness. His chief work is <i>Coelum
Britannicum</i>. He lived the easy and careless life of a courtier of
the day, but is said to have <i>d.</i> in a repentant frame. His poems,
consisting chiefly of short lyrics, were <i>coll.</i> and <i>pub.</i> after his
death. One of the most beautiful and best known of his songs is
that beginning &quot;He that loves a rosy cheek.&quot;</p><br />

often with his own music, including <i>Chrononhotonthologos</i> (1734), a
burlesque on the mouthing plays of the day, and <i>The Dragon of
Wantley</i> (1744?). His poem, <i>Namby Pamby</i>, in ridicule of <a href='#PHILIPS_AMBROSE_1675_1749'>Ambrose

His finest work is in his short stories, collected under the title of
<i>Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry</i>, of which two series were
<i>pub.</i> in 1830 and 1832 respectively. He also wrote several longer
novels, of which the best is <i>Fardorougha the Miser</i> (1837), a work of
great power. Others are <i>The Misfortunes of Barny Branagan</i> (1841),
<i>Valentine M'Clutchy</i> (1845), <i>Rody the Rover</i> (1847), <i>The Squanders

and was associated with Principal Robertson as an ecclesiastical
leader. He was a man of great ability, shrewdness, and culture, and
the friend of most of the eminent literary men in Scotland of his day.
He left an autobiography in MS., which was ed. by Hill Burton,
and <i>pub.</i> in 1860, and which is one of the most interesting contemporary
accounts of his time. His stately appearance gained
for him the name of &quot;Jupiter&quot; C.</p><br />

<a name='CARLYLE_THOMAS_1795_1881'></a><p><b>CARLYLE, THOMAS (1795-1881).</b>
&mdash;Historian and essayist,
was <i>b.</i> at Ecclefechan in Dumfriesshire. His <i>f.</i>, James C., was a
<a name='Page_73'></a>stonemason, a man of intellect and strong character, and his mother
was, as he said, &quot;of the fairest descent, that of the pious, the just,
and the wise.&quot; His earliest education was received at the parish
school of Ecclefechan (the Entepfuhl of <i>Sartor Resartus</i>). Thence
he went to the Grammar School of Annan, and in 1809 to the
Univ. of Edin., the 90 miles to which he travelled on foot.
There he read voraciously, his chief study being mathematics.
After completing his &quot;Arts&quot; course, he went on to divinity with
the view of entering the Church, but about the middle of his course
found that he could not proceed. He became a schoolmaster first at
Annan and then at Kirkcaldy, where he formed a profound friendship
with <a href='#IRVING_EDWARD_1792_1834'>Edward Irving</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and met Margaret Gordon, afterwards
Lady Bannerman, believed by some to be the prototype
of <i>Blumine</i> in <i>Sartor</i>. Returning in 1819 to Edin. he for a time
studied law and took pupils; but his health was bad, he suffered
from insomnia and dyspepsia, and he tired of law. He was also
sorely bestead by mental and spiritual conflicts, which came to a
crisis in Leith Walk in June 1821 in a sudden uprising of defiance to
the devil and all his works, upon which the clouds lifted. For the
next two years, 1822-24, he acted as tutor to Charles Buller (whose
promising political career was cut short by his premature death)
and his brother. On the termination of this engagement he decided
upon a literary career, which he began by contributing articles
to the <i>Edinburgh Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>. In 1824 he translated Legendre's
<i>Geometry</i> (to which he prefixed an essay on Proportion), and Goethe's
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>; he also wrote for the <i>London Magazine</i> a <i>Life
of Schiller</i>. About this time he visited Paris and London, where
he met Hazlitt, Campbell, Coleridge, and others. Thereafter he
returned to Dumfriesshire. In the following year (1826) he <i>m.</i> Jane Baillie Welsh, and settled in Edin. Here his first work
was <i>Specimens of German Romance</i> (4 vols.) A much more important
matter was his friendship with Jeffrey and his connection
with the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, in which appeared, among others, his
essays on <i>Richter</i>, <i>Burns</i>, <i>Characteristics</i>, and <i>German Poetry</i>. In
1828 C. applied unsuccessfully for the Chair of Moral Philosophy in
St. Andrews, and the same year he went to Craigenputtock, a small
property in Dumfriesshire belonging to Mrs. C., where they remained
for several years, and where many of his best essays and <i>Sartor
Resartus</i> were written, and where his correspondence with Goethe
began. In 1831 he went to London to find a publisher for <i>Sartor</i>,
but was unsuccessful, and it did not appear in book form until 1838,
after having come out in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> in 1833-34. The year
last mentioned found him finally in London, settled in Cheyne Row,
Chelsea, his abode for the rest of his life. He immediately set to
work on his <i>French Revolution</i>. While it was in progress he in 1835
lent the MS. to J.S. Mill, by whose servant nearly the whole of the
first vol. was burned, in spite of which misfortune the work was ready
for publication in 1837. Its originality, brilliance, and vividness
took the world by storm, and his reputation as one of the foremost
men of letters in the country was at once and finally established.
In the same year he appeared as a public lecturer, and delivered
four courses on <i>German Literature</i>, <i>Periods of European Culture</i>,
<i>Revolutions of Modern Europe</i>, and <i>Heroes and Hero-Worship</i>, the
<a name='Page_74'></a>last of which was <i>pub.</i> as a book in 1841. Although his writings
did not yet produce a large income, his circumstances had become
comfortable, owing to Mrs. C. having succeeded to her patrimony in
1840. Books now followed each other rapidly, <i>Chartism</i> had appeared
in 1839, <i>Past and Present</i> came out in 1843, and <i>Letters and
Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</i> in 1845, the last named being perhaps
the most successful of his writings, inasmuch as it fully attained the
object aimed at in clearing Cromwell from the ignorant or malevolent
aspersions under which he had long lain, and giving him his
just place among the greatest of the nation. In 1850 he <i>pub.</i> his
fiercest blast, <i>Latter Day Pamphlets</i>, which was followed next year
by his biography of his friend <a href='#STERLING_JOHN_1806_1844'>John Sterling</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). It was about
this time, as is shown by the <i>Letters and Memoirs</i> of Mrs. C., that a
temporary estrangement arose between his wife and himself, based
apparently on Mrs. C.'s part upon his friendship with Lady Ashburton,
a cause of which C. seems to have been unconscious. In
1851 he began his largest, if not his greatest work, <i>Frederick the
Great</i>, which occupied him from that year until 1865, and in connection
with which he made two visits to Germany in 1852 and 1858.
It is a work of astonishing research and abounds in brilliant
passages, but lacks the concentrated intensity of <i>The French Revolution</i>.
It is, however, the one of his works which enjoys the highest
reputation in Germany. In 1865 he was elected Lord Rector of the
Univ. of Edin., and delivered a remarkable address to the students by
whom he was received with enthusiasm. Almost immediately afterwards
a heavy blow fell upon him in the death of Mrs. C., and in the
discovery, from her diary, of how greatly she had suffered, unknown
to him, from the neglect and want of consideration which, owing to
absorption in his work and other causes, he had perhaps unconsciously
shown. Whatever his faults, of which the most was made
in some quarters, there can be no doubt that C. and his wife were
sincerely attached to each other, and that he deeply mourned her.
In 1866 his <i>Reminiscences</i> (<i>pub.</i> 1881) were written. The Franco-German
War of 1870-71 profoundly interested him, and evoked a
plea for Germany. From this time his health began to give way
more and more. In 1872 his right hand became paralysed. In
1874 he received the distinction of the Prussian Order of Merit, as
the biographer of its founder, and in the same year, Mr. Disraeli
offered him the choice of the Grand Cross of the Bath or a baronetcy
and a pension, all of which he declined. The completion of his 80th
year in 1875 was made the occasion of many tributes of respect and
veneration, including a gold medal from some of his Scottish
admirers. He <i>d.</i> on February 5, 1881. Burial in Westminster
Abbey was offered, but he had left instructions that he should lie
with his kindred. He bequeathed the property of Craigenputtock
to the Univ. of Edin.</p>

<p>C. exercised a very powerful influence upon the thought of his age,
not only by his own writings and personality, but through the
many men of distinction both in literature and active life whom he
imbued with his doctrines; and perhaps no better proof of this
exists than the fact that much that was new and original when first
propounded by him has passed into the texture of the national
ideas. His style is perhaps the most remarkable and individual in
<a name='Page_75'></a>our literature, intensely strong, vivid, and picturesque, but utterly
unconventional, and often whimsical or explosive. He had in a
high degree the poetic and imaginative faculty, and also irresistible
humour, pungent sarcasm, insight, tenderness, and fierce indignation.</p>

<p>All the works of C. shed light on his personality, but <i>Sartor
Resartus</i> especially may be regarded as autobiographical. Froude's
<i>Thomas Carlyle ... First 40 Years of his Life</i> (1882), <i>Thomas Carlyle ... His
Life in London</i>, by the same (1884), <i>Letters and
Memories of Jane Welsh Carlyle</i> (1883), various <i>Lives</i> and <i>Reminiscences</i>
by Prof. Masson and Nichol, etc.</p>

his master's death in 1441 he went to Bruges, and lived there and in
various other places in the Low Countries for over 30 years, engaged
apparently as head of an association of English merchants trading
in foreign parts, and in negotiating commercial treaties between
England and the Dukes of Burgundy. His first literary labour was
a translation of a French romance, which he entitled <i>The Recuyell of
the Historyes of Troye</i>, and which he finished in 1471. About this
time he learned the art of printing, and, after being in the service of<a name='Page_77'></a>
Margaret Duchess of Burgundy, an English princess, returned to his
native country and set up at Westminster in 1476 his printing press,
the first in England. His <i>Recuyell</i> and <i>The Game and Playe of
Chesse</i> had already been printed&mdash;the first books in English&mdash;on
the Continent. Here was produced the first book printed in England,
<i>The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers</i> (1477). C. obtained
Royal favour, printed from 80 to 100 separate works&mdash;many of them
translations of his own&mdash;and <i>d.</i> almost with pen in hand in 1491.

As nothing else is known of him it has been held by some that the
name was a <i>nom-de-plume</i> of W. himself. It has been shown, however,
that a gentleman of the name existed during the reign of

Baltimore; but on the outbreak of the Revolutionary War returned
to Britain, and settled in London as a clerk in the Board of Trade.
He <i>pub.</i> in 1780 a <i>History of the United Colonies</i>, and wrote lives of
Sir David Lyndsay, De Foe, and Mary Queen of Scots. His great
work, however, is his <i>Caledonia</i>, of which 3 vols. had been <i>pub.</i> at
his death. It was to have been a complete <i>coll.</i> of the topography
and antiquities of Scotland; and, as it stands, is a monument
of industry and research, though not always trustworthy in
disputed points. Besides those mentioned, C. was the author of
many other works on political, historical, and literary subjects, and
had projected several which he was unable to carry out.</p><br />

<a name='CHALMERS_THOMAS_1780_1847'></a><p><b>CHALMERS, THOMAS (1780-1847).</b>
&mdash;Divine, economist,
and philanthropist, <i>b.</i> at Anstruther, Fife, <i>s.</i> of a shipowner and
merchant, studied at St. Andrews and, entering the ministry of
the Church of Scotland, was first settled in the small parish of
Kilmeny, Fife, but, his talents and eloquence becoming known, he
was, in 1815, translated to Glasgow, where he was soon recognised
as the most eloquent preacher in Scotland, and where also he
initiated his schemes for the management of the poor. In 1823,
<a name='Page_78'></a>he became Prof. of Moral Philosophy at St. Andrews, and in 1828
of Divinity in Edin. In 1834 he began his great scheme of
Church extension, the result of which was that in seven years
&pound;300,000 had been raised, and 220 churches built. In the same
year, 1834, began the troubles and controversies in regard to
patronage and the relations of Church and State, which in 1843
ended in the disruption of the Church, when 470 ministers with
C. at their head, resigned their benefices, and founded the Free
Church of Scotland. C. was chosen its first Moderator and Principal
of its Theological Coll. in Edin. The remaining four years of
his life were spent in organising the new Church, and in works
of philanthropy. He was found dead in bed on the morning of
May 30, 1847. His chief works, which were <i>coll.</i> and <i>pub.</i> in 34
vols., relate to natural theology, evidences of Christianity, political
economy, and general theology and science. Those which perhaps
attracted most attention were his <i>Astronomical Discourses</i> and his
<i>Lectures on Church Establishments</i>, the latter delivered in London to
audiences containing all that was most distinguished in rank and
intellect in the country. The style of C. is cumbrous, and often
turgid, but the moral earnestness, imagination, and force of intellect
of the writer shine through it and irradiate his subjects. And yet
the written is described by contemporaries to have been immeasurably
surpassed by the spoken word, which carried away the hearer
as in a whirlwind. And the man was even greater than his achievements.
His character was one of singular simplicity, nobility, and
lovableness, and produced a profound impression on all who came
under his influence. The character of his intellect was notably
practical, as is evidenced by the success of his parochial administration
and the &quot;Sustentation Fund,&quot; devised by him for the support
of the ministry of the Free Church. He was D.D., LL.D., D.C.L.
(Oxon.), and a Corresponding Member of the Institute of France.</p>

he started business as a bookseller in Edin. at the age of
16, devoting all his spare time to study, to such purpose that in
1824 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Traditions of Edinburgh</i>, a work in which he had the
assistance of Sir W. Scott. Thereafter he poured forth a continuous
stream of books and essays on historical, social, antiquarian, and
scientific subjects. He joined his brother <a href='#CHAMBERS_WILLIAM_1800_1883'>William</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) in establishing
the publishing firm of W. and R. Chambers, and in starting
<i>Chambers's Journal</i>, to which he was a constant contributor. Later
ventures were <i>The Cyclopedia of English Literature</i> (1842-44), of
which several ed. have appeared (last 1903-6). and <i>Chambers's

he wrote several books, including a <i>History of Peeblesshire</i> (1864),
and an autobiography of himself and his brother. C. was a man of
great business capacity, and, though of less literary distinction than
his brother, did much for the dissemination of cheap and useful
literature. He was Lord Provost of Edin. 1865-69, and was an
LL.D. of the Univ. of that city. He restored the ancient church

the Congregationalist Church, but became the leader of the Unitarians
in New England. He had a powerful influence on the thought and
literature of his time in America, and was the author of books on
Milton and F&eacute;nelon, and on social subjects. The elevation and
amiability of his character caused him to be held in high esteem.
He did not class himself with Unitarians of the school of Priestley,
but claimed to &quot;stand aloof from all but those who strive and pray
for clearer light.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='CHAPMAN_GEORGE_1559_1634'></a><p><b>CHAPMAN, GEORGE (1559-1634).</b>

He wrote many plays, including <i>The Blind Beggar of Alexandria</i>
(1596), <i>All Fools</i> (1599), <i>A Humerous Daye's Myrthe</i> (1599), <i>Eastward
Hoe</i> (with Jonson), <i>The Gentleman Usher</i>, <i>Monsieur d'Olive</i>, etc.
As a dramatist he has humour, and vigour, and occasional poetic
fire, but is very unequal. His great work by which he lives in
literature is his translation of Homer. The <i>Iliad</i> was <i>pub.</i> in 1611,
the <i>Odyssey</i> in 1616, and the <i>Hymns</i>, etc., in 1624. The work is full
of energy and spirit, and well maintains its place among the many
later translations by men of such high poetic powers as Pope and
Cowper, and others: and it had the merit of suggesting Keats's
immortal Sonnet, in which its name and memory are embalmed for
many who know it in no other way. C. also translated from
Petrarch, and completed Marlowe's unfinished <i>Hero and Leander</i>.</p><br />

<a name='CHATTERTON_THOMAS_1752_1770'></a><p><b>CHATTERTON, THOMAS (1752-1770).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Bristol,
posthumous <i>s.</i> of a schoolmaster, who had been a man of some reading
and antiquarian tastes, after whose death his mother maintained
herself and her boy and girl by teaching and needlework. A black-letter
Bible and an illuminated music-book belonging to her were
the first things to give his mind the impulse which led to such
mingled glory and disaster. Living under the shadow of the great
church of St. Mary Redcliffe, his mind was impressed from infancy
with the beauty of antiquity, he obtained access to the charters
deposited there, and he read every scrap of ancient literature that
came in his way. At 14 he was apprenticed to a solicitor named
Lambert, with whom he lived in sordid circumstances, eating in the
kitchen and sleeping with the foot-boy, but continuing his favourite
studies in every spare moment. In 1768 a new bridge was opened,
and C. contributed to a local newspaper what purported to be a
contemporary account of the old one which it superseded. This
attracted a good deal of attention. Previously to this he had been
writing verses and imitating ancient poems under the name of
Thomas Rowley, whom he feigned to be a monk of the 15th century.
Hearing of H. Walpole's collections for his <i>Anecdotes of Painting in
England</i>, he sent him an &quot;ancient manuscript&quot; containing biographies
of certain painters, not hitherto known, who had flourished
in England centuries before. W. fell into the trap, and wrote asking
for all the MS. he could furnish, and C. in response forwarded
accounts of more painters, adding some particulars as to himself
on which W., becoming suspicious, submitted the whole to <a href='#GRAY_THOMAS_1716_1771'>T. Gray</a>
and <a href='#MASON_WILLIAM_1724_1797'>Mason</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), who pronounced the MS. to be forgeries. Some
correspondence, angry on C.'s part, ensued, and the whole budget
of papers was returned. C. thereafter, having been dismissed by
Lambert, went to London, and for a short time his prospects seemed
to be bright. He worked with feverish energy, threw off poems,
satires, and political papers, and meditated a history of England;
but funds and spirits failed, he was starving, and the failure to
obtain an appointment as ship's surgeon, for which he had applied,
drove him to desperation, and on the morning of August 25, 1770, he
was found dead from a dose of arsenic, surrounded by his writings torn
into small pieces. From childhood C. had shown a morbid familiarity
with the idea of suicide, and had written a last will and testament,
&quot;executed in the presence of Omniscience,&quot; and full of wild and
profane wit. The magnitude of his tragedy is only realised when it
is considered not only that the poetry he left was of a high order of
originality and imaginative power, but that it was produced at an
<a name='Page_81'></a>age at which our greatest poets, had they died, would have remained
unknown. Precocious not only in genius but in dissipation, proud
and morose as he was, an unsympathetic age confined itself mainly
to awarding blame to his literary and moral delinquencies.
Posterity has weighed him in a juster balance, and laments the
early quenching of so brilliant a light. His <i>coll.</i> works appeared in
1803, and another ed. by Prof. Street in 1875. Among these are
<i>Elinoure and Juga</i>, <i>Balade of Charitie</i>, <i>Bristowe Tragedie</i>, <i>&AElig;lla</i>, and
<i>Tragedy of Godwin</i>.</p>

<a name='CHAUCER_GEOFFREY_1340_1400'></a><p><b>CHAUCER, GEOFFREY (1340?-1400).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i> in
London, the <i>s.</i> of John C., a vintner of Thames Street, who had also
a small estate at Ipswich, and was occasionally employed on service
for the King (Edward III.), which doubtless was the means of his
son's introduction to the Court. The acquaintance which C. displays
with all branches of the learning of his time shows that he must
have received an ample education; but there is no evidence
that he was at either of the Univ. In 1357 he appears as a page
to the Lady Elizabeth, wife of Lionel Duke of Clarence, and in
1359 he first saw military service in France, when he was made a
prisoner. He was, however, ransomed in 1360. About 1366 he was
married to Philippa, <i>dau.</i> of Sir Payne Roet, one of the ladies of the
Duchess of Lancaster, whose sister Katharine, widow of Sir Hugh
Swynford, became the third wife of John of Gaunt. Previous to this
he had apparently been deeply in love with another lady, whose rank
probably placed her beyond his reach; his disappointment finding
expression in his <i>Compleynt to Pit&eacute;</i>. In 1367 he was one of the
valets of the King's Chamber, a post always held by gentlemen, and
received a pension of 20 marks, and he was soon afterwards one of
the King's esquires. In 1369 Blanche, the wife of John of Gaunt,
died, which gave occasion for a poem by C. in honour of her
memory, <i>The Dethe of Blaunche the Duchesse</i>. In the same year he
again bore arms in France, and during the next ten years he was
frequently employed on diplomatic missions. In 1370 he was sent
to Genoa to arrange a commercial treaty, on which occasion he may
have met Petrarch, and was rewarded by a grant in 1374 of a
pitcher of wine daily. In the same year he got from the corporation
of London a lease for life of a house at Aldgate, on condition of keeping
it in repair; and soon after he was appointed Comptroller of the
Customs and Subsidy of Wool, Skins, and Leather in the port of
London; he also received from the Duke of Lancaster a pension of
&pound;10. In 1375 he obtained the guardianship of a rich ward, which
he held for three years, and the next year he was employed on a
secret service. In 1377 he was sent on a mission to Flanders to
treat of peace with the French King. After the accession of
Richard II. in that year, he was sent to France to treat for the
marriage of the King with the French Princess Mary, and thereafter
to Lombardy, on which occasion he appointed <a href='#GOWER_JOHN_1325_1408'>John Gower</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) to
act for him in his absence in any legal proceedings which might
arise. In 1382 he became Comptroller of the Petty Customs of the
port of London, and in 1385 was allowed to appoint a deputy, which,
enabled him to devote more time to writing. He had in 1373
<a name='Page_82'></a>begun his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, on which he was occupied at intervals
for the rest of his life. In 1386 C. was elected Knight of the Shire
for Kent, a county with which he appears to have had some connection,
and where he may have had property. His fortunes now
suffered some eclipse. His patron, John of Gaunt, was abroad, and
the government was presided over by his brother Gloucester, who
was at feud with him. Owing probably to this cause, C. was in
December, 1386, dismissed from his employments, leaving him
with no income beyond his pensions, on which he was obliged to
raise money. His wife also died at the same time. In 1389, however,
Richard took the government into his own hands, and
prosperity returned to C., whose friends were now in power, and he
was appointed Clerk of the King's works. This office, however, he
held for two years only, and again fell into poverty, from which he
was rescued in 1394 by a pension from the King of &pound;20. On the
accession of Henry IV. (1399) an additional pension of 40 marks
was given him. In the same year he took a lease of a house at
Westminster, where he probably <i>d.</i>, October 25, 1400. He is buried
in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey, where a monument to him
was erected by Nicholas Brigham, a minor poet of the 16th century.
According to some authorities he left two sons, Thomas, who became
a man of wealth and importance, and Lewis, who died young, the
little ten-year-old boy to whom he addressed the treatise on the
<i>Astrolabe</i>. Others see no evidence that Thomas was any relation
of the poet. An Elizabeth C., placed in the Abbey of Barking by
John of Gaunt, was probably his <i>dau.</i> In person C. was inclined to
corpulence, &quot;no poppet to embrace,&quot; of fair complexion with &quot;a
beard the colour of ripe wheat,&quot; an &quot;elvish&quot; expression, and an
eye downcast and meditative.</p>

<p>Of the works ascribed to C. several are, for various reasons, of
greater or less strength, considered doubtful. These include <i>The
Romaunt of the Rose</i>, <i>Chaucer's Dream</i>, and <i>The Flower and the Leaf</i>.
After his return from Italy about 1380 he entered upon his period
of greatest productiveness: <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> (1382?), <i>The
Parlement of Foules</i> (1382?), <i>The House of Fame</i> (1384?), and <i>The
Legende of Goode Women</i> (1385), belong to this time. The first of
them still remains one of the finest poems of its kind in the language.
But the glory of C. is, of course, the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, a work which
places him in the front rank of the narrative poets of the world. It
contains about 18,000 lines of verse, besides some passages in prose,
and was left incomplete. In it his power of story-telling, his
humour, sometimes broad, sometimes sly, his vivid picture-drawing,
his tenderness, and lightness of touch, reach their highest development.
He is our first artist in poetry, and with him begins modern
English literature. His character&mdash;genial, sympathetic, and
pleasure-loving, yet honest, diligent, and studious&mdash;is reflected in
his writings.</p>

&mdash;Statesman
and letter-writer, was the eldest <i>s.</i> of the
3rd Earl. After being at Trinity Coll., Camb., he sat in the House
of Commons until his accession to the peerage in 1726. He filled
many high offices, including those of Ambassador to Holland,
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Sec. of State. He was distinguished
for his wit, conversational powers, and grace of manner.
His place in literature is fixed by his well-known <i>Letters</i> addressed
to his natural son, Philip Dormer Stanhope. Though brilliant, and
full of shrewdness and knowledge of the world, they reflect the low
tone of morals prevalent in the age when they were written. He
was the recipient of Johnson's famous letter as to his &quot;patronage.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='CHETTLE_HENRY_1565_1607'></a><p><b>CHETTLE, HENRY (1565-1607?).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist. Very little
is known of him. He ed. R. Greene's <i>Groat's-worth of Wit</i> (1592),
is believed to have written 13 and collaborated in 35 plays. He also
wrote two satires, <i>Kind Harts Dreame</i> (1593), and <i>Pierre Plainnes
Prentship</i> (1595). He was imprisoned for debt 1599.</p>

<p>Among his own plays, which have considerable merit, is <i>Hoffmann</i>,
which has been reprinted, and he had a hand in <i>Patient Grissill</i>
(1603) (which may have influenced Shakespeare in the <i>Merry Wives

of early English, and especially of ancient ballads in America. He
ed. the American ed. of English Poets in 130 vols., and English and
Scottish Ballads. He was also a profound student of Chaucer, and
<i>pub.</i> <i>Observations on the Language of Chaucer</i>, and <i>Observations on the

&mdash;Theologian
and controversialist, <i>b.</i> and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., was godson of Archbishop
Laud. Falling into theological doubts he subsequently became a
convert to Roman Catholicism, and studied at the Jesuit Coll. at
Douay, 1630. In the following year he returned to Oxf., and
after further consideration of the points at issue, he rejoined the
Church of England, 1634. This exposed him to violent attacks on
the part of the Romanists, in reply to which he <i>pub.</i> in 1637 his
<a name='Page_84'></a>famous polemic, <i>The Religion of the Protestants a Safe Way to Salvation</i>,
characterised by clear style and logical reasoning. For a
time he refused ecclesiastical preferment, but ultimately his scruples
were overcome, and he became Prebendary and Chancellor of Salisbury.
C. is regarded as one of the ablest controversialists of the
Anglican Church.</p><br />

became a friend of <a href='#NEWMAN_JOHN_HENRY_1801_1890'>J.H. Newman</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). He took orders, and became
Rector of Whatley, Somerset, and in 1871 Dean of St. Paul's. He
was a leading member of the High Church party, but was held in
reverence by many who did not sympathise with his ecclesiastical
views. Among his writings are <i>The Beginning of the Middle Ages</i>
(1877), and a memoir on <i>The Oxford Movement</i> (1891), <i>pub.</i> posthumously.
He also wrote Lives of Anselm, Dante, Spenser, and Bacon.</p><br />

made a clandestine marriage. He entered the Church, and on
the death of his <i>f.</i> in 1758 succeeded him in the curacy and lectureship
of St. John's, Westminster. In 1761 he <i>pub.</i> the <i>Rosciad</i>, in
which he severely satirised the players and managers of the day.
It at once brought him both fame and money; but he fell into
dissipated habits, separated from his wife, and outraged the proprieties
of his profession to such an extent that he was compelled
to resign his preferments. He also incurred the enmity of those
whom he had attacked, which led to the publication of two other
satirical pieces, <i>The Apology</i> and <i>Night</i>. He also attacked Dr.
Johnson and his circle in <i>The Ghost</i>, and the Scotch in <i>The
Prophecy of Famine</i>. He attached himself to John Wilkes, on a

&mdash;Poet and miscellaneous
writer, began life as a page to the Earl of Surrey, and subsequently
passed through many vicissitudes as a soldier in Scotland,
Ireland, France, and the Low Countries. He was latterly a hanger-on
at Court, and had a pension of eighteenpence a day from Queen
Elizabeth, which was not, however, regularly paid. He wrote innumerable
pamphlets and broadsides, and some poems, of which
the best are <i>Shore's Wife</i> (1563), <i>The Worthiness of Wales</i> (1587)
<i>repub.</i> by the Spenser Society (1871), and <i>Churchyard's Chips</i> (1575),

in London, <i>s.</i> of a Danish sculptor, and <i>ed.</i> at Grantham School.
Soon after his return to London he took to the stage. Beginning
with tragedy, in which he failed, he turned to comedy, and became
popular in eccentric <i>r&ocirc;les</i>. In 1696 he brought out his first play,
<i>Love's Last Shift</i>, and produced in all about 30 plays, some of which
were very successful. In 1730 he was made Poet Laureate, and
wrote some forgotten odes of no merit, also an entertaining autobiography.
Pope made him the hero of the <i>Dunciad</i>.</p>

<p>Among other plays are <i>The Nonjuror</i> (1717), <i>Woman's Wit</i>, <i>She<a name='Page_85'></a>

<a name='CLARE_JOHN_1793_1864'></a><p><b>CLARE, JOHN (1793-1864).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a cripple pauper,
was <i>b.</i> at Helpstone near Peterborough. His youth is the record of
a noble struggle against adverse circumstances. With great difficulty
he managed to save one pound, with which he was able to have
a prospectus of his first book of poems printed, which led to an
acquaintance with Mr. Drury, a bookseller in Stamford, by whose
help the poems were <i>pub.</i>, and brought him &pound;20. The book, <i>Poems
descriptive of Rural Life</i> (1820), immediately attracted attention.
Various noblemen befriended him and stocked a farm for him.
But unfortunately C. had no turn for practical affairs, and got into
difficulties. He, however, continued to produce poetry, and in
addition to <i>The Village Minstrel</i>, which had appeared in 1821,
<i>pub.</i> <i>The Shepherd's Calendar</i> (1827), and <i>Rural Muse</i> (1835).
Things, however, went on from bad to worse; his mind gave way,
and he <i>d.</i> in an asylum. C. excels in description of rural scenes and
the feelings and ideas of humble country life.</p><br />

<a name='CLARENDON_EDWARD_HYDE_EARL_of_1608_1674'></a><p><b>CLARENDON, EDWARD HYDE, EARL of (1608-1674).</b>
&mdash;Lawyer,
statesman, and historian, <i>s.</i> of a country gentleman of good
estate in Wiltshire, was <i>b.</i> at Dinton in that county, and <i>ed.</i> at
Oxf. Destined originally for the Church, circumstances led to
his being sent to London to study law, which he did under his uncle,
Sir Nicholas H., Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In early life he
was the friend of all the leading men of the day. Entering Parliament
in 1640 he at first supported popular measures, but, on the
outbreak of the Civil War, attached himself to the King, and was
the author of many of his state papers. From 1648 until the
Restoration C. was engaged in various embassies and as a counsellor
of Charles II., who made him in 1658 his Lord Chancellor, an
office in which he was confirmed at the Restoration, when he also
became Chancellor of the Univ. of Oxf., and was likewise raised
to the peerage. His power and influence came to an end, however,
in 1667, when he was dismissed from all his offices, was impeached,
and had to fly to France. The causes of his fall were partly the
miscarriage of the war with Holland, and the sale of Dunkirk, and
partly the jealousy of rivals and the intrigues of place hunters,
whose claims he had withstood. In his enforced retirement he
engaged himself in completing his great historic work, <i>The History
of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England</i>, which he had begun in
1641, and which was not <i>pub.</i> until 1702-4. C.'s style is easy,
flowing, diffuse, and remarkably modern, with an occasional want
of clearness owing to his long and involved sentences. His great
strength is in character-painting, in which he is almost unrivalled.
The <i>History</i> was followed by a supplementary <i>History of the Civil
War in Ireland</i> (1721). C. also wrote an autobiography, <i>The Life
of Edward Earl of Clarendon</i> (1759), a reply to the <i>Leviathan</i> of
Hobbes, and <i>An Essay on the Active and Contemplative Life</i>, in
which the superiority of the former is maintained. C. <i>d.</i> at Rouen.
He was a man of high personal character, and great intellect and
sagacity, but lacking in the firmness and energy necessary for the
troublous times in which he lived. His <i>dau.</i> Anne married the<a name='Page_86'></a>
Duke of York, afterwards James II., a connection which involved
him in much trouble and humiliation.</p>

and on European literature. Latterly he lived in France
and Italy. His wife, MARY C.-C. (1809-1898), <i>dau.</i> of V. Novello,
musician, compiled a complete <i>Concordance to Shakespeare</i> (1844-45),
and wrote <i>The Shakespeare Key</i> (1879) and, with her husband,

&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i> in London,
the <i>s.</i> of a barrister. After a somewhat wild youth he went to
Australia where, after more than one failure to achieve success in
business, he took to journalism on the staff of the <i>Melbourne Argus</i>,
with brilliant results. He wrote two novels, <i>Long Odds</i> and <i>For the
Term of his Natural Life</i> (1874), the latter, which is generally considered
his masterpiece, dealing in a powerful and realistic manner
with transportation and convict labour. He also wrote many
short tales and dramatic pieces. After a turbulent and improvident
life he <i>d.</i> at 35. In addition to the works above mentioned, he
wrote <i>Lower Bohemia in Melbourne</i>, <i>The Humbug Papers</i>, <i>The
Future Australian Race</i>. As a writer he was keen, brilliant, and
bitter.</p><br />

<a name='CLARKE_SAMUEL_1675_1729'></a><p><b>CLARKE, SAMUEL (1675-1729).</b>
&mdash;Divine and metaphysician,
<i>b.</i> at Norwich, was <i>ed.</i> at Camb., where he became the friend
and disciple of Newton, whose System of the Universe he afterwards
defended against Leibnitz. In 1704-5 he delivered the Boyle
lectures, taking for his subject, <i>The Being and Attributes of God</i>, and
assuming an intermediate position between orthodoxy and Deism.
In 1712 he <i>pub.</i> views on the doctrine of the Trinity which involved
him in trouble, from which he escaped by a somewhat unsatisfactory
explanation. He was, however, one of the most powerful opponents
of the freethinkers of the time. In addition to his theological
writings C. <i>pub.</i> an ed. of the <i>Iliad</i>, a Latin translation of the
<i>Optics</i> of Newton, on whose death he was offered the Mastership of
the Mint, an office worth &pound;1500 a year, which, however, he declined.
The talents, learning, and amiable disposition of C. gave him a high
place in the esteem of his contemporaries. In the Church he held
various preferments, the last being that of Rector of St. James's,
Westminster. He was also Chaplain to Queen Anne. His style
is cold, dry, and precise.</p><br />

<a name='CLEVELAND_JOHN_1613_1658'></a><p><b>CLEVELAND, JOHN (1613-1658).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of an usher in
a charity school, was <i>b.</i> at Loughborough, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., where
he became coll. tutor and lecturer on rhetoric at St. John's, and
was much sought after. A staunch Royalist, he opposed the election
of Oliver Cromwell as member for Camb. in the Long Parliament,
and was in consequence ejected from his coll. in 1645. Joining
the King, by whom he was welcomed, he was appointed to the office
<a name='Page_87'></a>of Judge Advocate at Newark. In 1646, however, he was deprived
of this, and wandered about the country dependent on the bounty
of the Royalists. In 1655 he was imprisoned at Yarmouth, but
released by Cromwell, to whom he appealed, and went to London,
where he lived in much consideration till his death. His best
work is satirical, giving a faint adumbration of <i>Hudibras</i>; his other
poems, with occasional passages of great beauty, being affected and
artificial. The <i>Poems</i> were <i>pub.</i> in 1656.</p><br />

<a name='CLINTON_HENRY_FYNES_1781_1852'></a><p><b>CLINTON, HENRY FYNES (1781-1852).</b>
&mdash;Chronologist, <i>b.</i> at
Gamston, Notts, <i>ed.</i> at Southwell, Westminster, and Oxf., where he
devoted himself chiefly to the study of Greek. Brought into Parliament
by the Duke of Newcastle in 1806, he took no active part in
political life, and retired in 1826. He bought in 1810 the estate of
Welwyn, and there he entered upon wide and profound studies bearing
upon classical chronology, and wrote various important treatises
on the subject, viz., <i>Fasti Hellenici, Civil and Literary Chronology
of Greece</i>, part i. (1824), part ii. (1827), part iii. (1830), part iv.
(1841), <i>Fasti Romani, Civil and Literary Chronology of Rome and
Constantinople</i>, vol. i. (1850), vol. ii. (1851), <i>An Epitome of the Civil
and Literary Chronology of Greece</i> (1851), the same for Rome (1853).
He also wrote a tragedy, <i>Solyman</i>, which was a failure.</p><br />

<a name='CLOUGH_ARTHUR_HUGH_1819_1861'></a><p><b>CLOUGH, ARTHUR HUGH (1819-1861).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a
cotton merchant in Liverpool, he spent his childhood in America,
but was sent back to England for his education, which he received
at Rugby and Oxf. While at the Univ., where he was tutor and
Fellow of Oriel, he fell under the influence of Newman, but afterwards
became a sceptic and resigned his Fellowship in 1848. In the
same year he <i>pub.</i> his poem, <i>The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich</i>, written
in hexameters. After travelling on the Continent for a year, he
was in 1849 appointed Warden of Univ. Hall, London. In 1849
appeared <i>Amours de Voyage</i>, a rhymed novelette, and the more
serious work, <i>Dipsychus</i>. In 1854 he was appointed an examiner in
the Education Office, and married. His last appointment was as
Sec. of a Commission on Military Schools, in connection with
which he visited various countries, but was seized with illness, and
<i>d.</i> at Florence. C. was a man of singularly sincere character, with a
passion for truth. His poems, though full of fine and subtle thought,
are, with the exception of some short lyrics, deficient in form, and
the hexameters which he employed in <i>The Bothie</i> are often rough,
though perhaps used as effectively as by any English verse-writer.
M. Arnold's <i>Thyrsis</i> was written in memory of C.</p><br />

Theodore Parker, she became a Unitarian. Her first work, <i>pub.</i>
anonymously, was on <i>The Intuitive Theory of Morals</i> (1855). She
travelled in the East, and <i>pub.</i> <i>Cities of the Past</i> (1864). Later
she became interested in social questions and philanthropic work,
and wrote many books on these and kindred subjects, including
<i>Criminals</i>, <i>Idiots</i>, <i>Women</i> and <i>Minors</i> (1869), <i>Darwinism in Morals</i>
(1872), and <i>Scientific Spirit of the Age</i> (1888). She was a strong

<a name='COBBETT_WILLIAM_1762_1835'></a><p><b>COBBETT, WILLIAM (1762-1835).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and political
writer, <i>b.</i> at Farnham, Surrey, <i>s.</i> of a small farmer, his youth was
spent as a farm labourer, a clerk, and in the army, in which his good
conduct and intelligence led to his promotion to the rank of sergeant-major.
After moving about between England and America,
and alternating between journalism and agriculture, in the former
of which his daring opposition to men in power got him into frequent
trouble and subjected him to heavy fines in both countries,
he settled down in England in 1800, and continued his career as a
political writer, first as a Tory and then as a Radical. His violent
changes of opinion, and the force and severity with which he expressed
himself naturally raised up enemies in both camps. In 1817
he went back to America, where he remained for two years. Returning
he stood, in 1821, for a seat in Parliament, but was unsuccessful.
In 1832, however, he was returned for Oldham, but made
no mark as a speaker. C. was one of the best known men of his day.
His intellect was narrow, but intensely clear, and he was master of
a nervous and idiomatic English style which enabled him to project
his ideas into the minds of his readers. His chief writings are
<i>English Grammar</i>, <i>Rural Rides</i>, <i>Advice to Young Men and Women</i>.
His <i>Weekly Political Register</i> was continued from 1802 until his
death.</p><br />

member of the Scottish Bar, and ultimately a judge. He was also one
of the leaders of the Whig party in Scotland in its days of darkness
prior to the Reform Act of 1832. The life-long friend of Francis
Jeffrey, he wrote his life, <i>pub.</i> in 1852. His chief literary work,
however, is his <i>Memorials of his Time</i> (1856), continued in his
<i>Journal</i> (1874). These constitute an autobiography of the writer
interspersed with notices of manners, public events, and sketches of
his contemporaries, of great interest and value.</p><br />

Coll., Camb., where he was a tutor, entered the Church, and <i>pub.</i>
various mathematical treatises and <i>Village Sermons</i>. In 1853 he
was appointed first Bishop of Natal. He mastered the Zulu
language, introduced printing, wrote a Zulu grammar and dictionary,
and many useful reading-books for the natives. His <i>Commentary
on the Romans</i> (1861) excited great opposition from the High Church
party, and his <i>Critical Examination of the Pentateuch</i> (1862-1879), by
its then extreme views, created great alarm and excitement. He
was in 1863 deposed and excommunicated by Bishop Gray of Cape
Town, but confirmed in his see by the Courts of Law. His theological
writings are now largely superseded; but his mathematical
text-books, for the writing of which he was much better equipped,

among the &quot;Lake poets.&quot; His early education was desultory, but
he was sent by Southey to Oxf. in 1815. His talents enabled him to
win a Fellowship, but the weakness of his character led to his being
deprived of it. He then went to London and wrote for magazines.
From 1823 to 1828 he tried keeping a school at Ambleside, which
failed, and he then led the life of a recluse at Grasmere until his
death. Here he wrote <i>Essays</i>, <i>Biographia Borealis</i> (lives of
worthies of the northern counties) (1832), and a <i>Life of Massinger</i>
(1839). He is remembered chiefly for his <i>Sonnets</i>. He also left unfinished
a drama, <i>Prometheus</i>.</p><br />

<a name='COLERIDGE_SAMUEL_TAYLOR_1772_1834'></a><p><b>COLERIDGE, SAMUEL TAYLOR (1772-1834).</b>
&mdash;Poet, philosopher,
and critic, <i>s.</i> of the Rev. John C., vicar and schoolmaster of
Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire, was <i>b.</i> there in 1772, the youngest of
13 children. He was at Christ's Hospital from 1782 to 1790, and
had Charles Lamb for a schoolfellow, and the famous scholar and
disciplinarian, James Boyer, for his master. Thence he proceeded
to Jesus Coll., Camb., in 1791, where he read much, but desultorily,
and got into debt. The troubles arising thence and also, apparently,
a disappointment in love, led to his going to London and enlisting
in the 15th Dragoons under the name of Silas Tomkyn Comberbacke.
He could not, however, be taught to ride, and through
some Latin lines written by him on a stable door, his real condition
was discovered, his friends communicated with, and his release
accomplished, his brothers buying him off. After this escapade he
returned (1794) to Camb. He had by this time imbibed extreme
democratic or, as he termed them, pantisocratic principles, and on
leaving Camb. in the same year he visited Oxf., where he made the
acquaintance of Southey, and discussed with him a project of founding
a &quot;pantisocracy&quot; on the banks of the Susquehanna, a scheme
which speedily fell through, owing firstly to want of funds, and
secondly to the circumstance of the two projectors falling in love
simultaneously with two sisters, Sarah and Edith Fricker, of whom
the former became, in 1795, the wife of C., and the latter of Southey.
C. had spent one more term at Camb., and there in Sept. 1794 his
first work, <i>The Fall of Robespierre</i>, a drama, to which Southey
contributed two acts, the second and third, was <i>pub.</i> After his
marriage he settled first at Clevedon, and thereafter at Nether
Stowey, Somerset, where he had Wordsworth for a neighbour, with
whom he formed an intimate association. About 1796 he fell into
the fatal habit of taking laudanum, which had such disastrous
effects upon his character and powers of will. In the same year
<i>Poems on various Subjects</i> appeared, and a little later <i>Ode to the Departing
Year</i>. While at Nether Stowey he was practically supported
by Thomas Poole, a tanner, with whom he had formed a
friendship. Here he wrote <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>, the first part of
<i>Christabel</i> and <i>Kubla Khan</i>, and here he joined with Wordsworth in
producing the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Some time previously he had
become a Unitarian, and was much engaged as a preacher in that
body, and for a short time acted as a minister at Shrewsbury. Influenced
by Josiah and Thomas Wedgwood, who each in 1798 gave
<a name='Page_90'></a>him an annuity of &pound;75 on condition of his devoting himself to literature,
he resigned this position, and soon afterwards went to Germany,
where he remained for over a year, an experience which profoundly
influenced the future development of his intellect. On his return
he made excursions with Southey and Wordsworth, and at the end
of 1799 went to London, where he wrote and reported for the <i>Morning
Post</i>. His great translation of Schiller's <i>Wallenstein</i> appeared
in 1800. In the same year he migrated to Greta Hall, near Keswick,
where he wrote the second part of <i>Christabel</i>. Soon after this his
health gave way, and he suffered much; and, whether as the cause
or the consequence of this, he had become a slave to opium. In
1804 he went to Malta in search of health, and there became the
friend of the governor, Sir Alexander Ball, who appointed him
his sec., in which position he showed remarkable capacity for
affairs. Resigning this occupation, of which he had become tired,
he travelled in Italy, and in the beginning of 1806 reached Rome,
where he enjoyed the friendship of Tieck, Humboldt, and Bunsen.
He returned to England in the end of 1806, and in 1808 delivered his
first course of lectures on Shakespeare at the Royal Institution, and
thereafter (1809), leaving his family at Keswick, he went to live
with Wordsworth at Grasmere. Here he started <i>The Friend</i>, a
philosophical and theological periodical, which lasted for 9 months.
That part of his annuity contributed by T. Wedgwood had been
confirmed to him by will in 1805, and this he allowed to his wife, but
in 1811 the remaining half was stopped. He delivered a second
course of lectures in London, and in 1813 his drama, <i>Remorse</i>, was
acted at Drury Lane with success. Leaving his family dependent
upon Southey, he lived with various friends, first, from 1816 to 1819,
with John Morgan at Calne. While there he <i>pub.</i> <i>Christabel</i> and
<i>Kubla Khan</i> in 1816, and in 1817 <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, <i>Sybilline
Leaves</i>, and an autobiography. In 1818 he appeared for the last
time as a lecturer. He found in 1819 a final resting-place in the
household of James Gillman, a surgeon, at Highgate. His life
thenceforth was a splendid wreck. His nervous system was shattered,
and he was a constant sufferer. Yet these last years were, in
some respects, his best. He maintained a struggle against opium
which lasted with his life, and though he ceased to write much, he
became the revered centre of a group of disciples, including such
men as Sterling, Maurice, and Hare, and thus indirectly continued
and increased his influence in the philosophic and theological
thought of his time. He returned to Trinitarianism, and a singular
and childlike humility became one of his most marked characteristics.
In 1824 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Society of Literature,
which brought him a pension of 100 guineas. His latest publications
were <i>Aids to Reflection</i> (1825) and <i>The Constitution of Church
and State</i>. After his death there were <i>pub.</i>, among other works,
<i>Table Talk</i> (1835), <i>Confessions of an Enquiring Spirit</i> (1840), <i>Letters</i>
and <i>Anima Poet&aelig;</i> (1895).</p>

<p>Endowed with an intellect of the first order, and an imagination
at once delicate and splendid, C., from a weakness of moral constitution,
and the lamentable habit already referred to, fell far short of
the performance which he had planned, and which included various
epic poems, and a complete system of philosophy, in which all
<a name='Page_91'></a>knowledge was to be co-ordinated. He has, however, left enough
poetry of such excellence as to place him in the first rank of English
poets, and enough philosophic, critical, and theological matter to
constitute him one of the principal intellectually formative forces
of his time. His knowledge of philosophy, science, theology, and
literature was alike wide and deep, and his powers of conversation,
or rather monologue, were almost unique. A description of him in
later life tells of &quot;the clerical-looking dress, the thick, waving,
silver hair, the youthful coloured cheek, the indefinable mouth and
lips, the quick, yet steady and penetrating greenish-grey eye, the
slow and continuous enunciation, and the everlasting music of his
tones.&quot;</p>

The only survivor of a family of 22, he went to Oxf. and Paris, and
thence to Italy, where he learned Greek. He entered the Church,
and held many preferments, including the Deanery of St. Paul's.
He continued to follow out his studies, devoting himself chiefly to
St. Paul's epistles. He was outspoken against the corruptions of
the Church, and would have been called to account but for the protection
of Archbishop Warham. He devoted his great fortune to
founding and endowing St. Paul's School. Among his works are a
treatise on the Sacraments and various devotional writings. It is
rather for his learning and his attitude to the advancement of knowledge
than for his own writings that he has a place in the history of
English literature.</p><br />

Camb., entered the Church, and became Rector of Ampton, Suffolk,
<a name='Page_92'></a>lecturer of Gray's Inn, London, and ultimately a nonjuring bishop.
He was a man of war from his youth, and was engaged in controversies
almost until his death. His first important one was with
Gilbert Burnet, and led to his being imprisoned in Newgate. He
was, however, a man of real learning. His chief writings are his
<i>Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain</i> (1708-1714), and especially his
<i>Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage</i>
(1699), on account of which he was attacked by Congreve and
Farquhar, for whom, however, he showed himself more than a
match. The work materially helped towards the subsequent
purification of the stage.</p><br />

&mdash;Novelist, <i>s.</i> of a
solicitor at Plymouth, was for a time a teacher of mathematics in
Guernsey. Settling in Berkshire he adopted a literary life, and was
a prolific author, writing largely for periodicals. He also wrote a
good deal of occasional and humorous verse, and several novels,
including <i>Sweet Anne Page</i> (1868), <i>Two Plunges for a Pearl</i> (1872),
<i>Mr. Carrington</i> (1873), under the name of &quot;R.T. Cotton,&quot; and <i>A

<a name='COLLINS_WILLIAM_1721_1759'></a><p><b>COLLINS, WILLIAM (1721-1759).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a respectable
hatter at Chichester, where he was <i>b.</i> He was <i>ed.</i> at Chichester,
Winchester, and Oxf. His is a melancholy career. Disappointed
with the reception of his poems, especially his Odes, he sank into
despondency, fell into habits of intemperance, and after fits of
melancholy, deepening into insanity, <i>d.</i> a physical and mental wreck.
Posterity has signally reversed the judgment of his contemporaries,
and has placed him at the head of the lyrists of his age. He did
not write much, but all that he wrote is precious. His first publication
was a small vol. of poems, including the <i>Persian</i> (afterwards
called <i>Oriental</i>) <i>Eclogues</i> (1742); but his principal work was his <i>Odes</i>
(1747), including those to <i>Evening</i> and <i>The Passions</i>, which will live
as long as the language. When Thomson died in 1748 C., who had
been his friend, commemorated him in a beautiful ode. Another&mdash;left
unfinished&mdash;that on the <i>Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands</i>,
was for many years lost sight of, but was discovered by <a name='Page_93'></a><a href='#CARLYLE_ALEXANDER_1722_1805'>Dr. Alex.

&mdash;Novelist, <i>s.</i> of
William C., R.A., entered Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the Bar
1851, but soon relinquished law for literature. His first novel was
<i>Antonina</i> (1850), a historical romance. He found his true field,
however, in the novel of modern life, in which his power lies chiefly
in the construction of a skilful plot, which holds the attention of the
reader and baffles his curiosity to the last. In Count Fosco, however,
he has contributed an original character to English fiction.
Among his numerous novels two, <i>The Woman in White</i> (1860), and
<i>The Moonstone</i> (1868), stand out pre-eminent. Others are <i>The Dead
Secret</i> (1857), <i>Armadale</i> (1866), <i>No Name</i> (1862), <i>After Dark, &quot;I say

Garrick, and took to writing for the stage with success. He wrote
more than 30 dramatic pieces, of which the best known are <i>The
Jealous Wife</i> (1761), and <i>The Clandestine Marriage</i> (1766). C. was
also manager and part proprietor of various theatres. He was a
scholar and translated Terence and the <i>De Arte Poetica</i> of Horace,
wrote essays, and ed. Beaumont and Fletcher and B. Jonson.</p><br />

<i>The Heir at Law</i> and <i>John Bull</i>. He was Examiner of Plays (1824-1836).
Many of his plays are highly amusing, and keep their place
on the stage. His wit made him popular in society, and he was a
favourite with George IV.</p><br />

lawyer. Latterly, however, he devoted himself to the promotion of
phrenology, and of his views on education, for which he in 1848
founded a school. His chief work was <i>The Constitution of Man</i>
(1828).</p><br />

<a name='COMBE_WILLIAM_1741_1823'></a><p><b>COMBE, WILLIAM (1741-1823).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous writer.
His early life was that of an adventurer, his later was passed chiefly
within the &quot;rules&quot; of the King's Bench prison. He is chiefly remembered
as the author of <i>The Three Tours of Dr. Syntax</i>, a comic
poem (?). His cleverest piece of work was a series of imaginary
<a name='Page_94'></a>letters, supposed to have been written by the second, or &quot;wicked&quot;
Lord Lyttelton. Of a similar kind were his letters between Swift
and Stella. He also wrote the letterpress for various illustrated
books, and was a general hack.</p><br />

Yorkshire. In boyhood he was taken to Ireland, and <i>ed.</i> at Kilkenny
and at Trinity Coll., Dublin. In 1688 he returned to England
and entered the Middle Temple, but does not appear to have
practised, and took to writing for the stage. His first comedy, <i>The
Old Bachelor</i>, was produced with great applause in 1693, and was
followed by <i>The Double Dealer</i> (1693), <i>Love for Love</i> (1695), and <i>The
Way of the World</i> (1700), and by a tragedy, <i>The Mourning Bride</i>
(1697). His comedies are all remarkable for wit and sparkling
dialogue, but their profanity and licentiousness have driven them
from the stage. These latter qualities brought them under the lash
of <a href='#COLLIER_JEREMY_1650_1726'>Jeremy Collier</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) in his <i>Short View of the English Stage</i>. Congreve
rushed into controversy with his critic who, however, proved
too strong for him. C. was a favourite at Court, and had various
lucrative offices conferred upon him. In his latter years he was
blind; otherwise his life was prosperous, and he achieved his chief
ambition of being admired as a fine gentleman and gallant.

but soon relinquished it, and devoting himself to scholarship, became
Prof. of Latin at Oxf. (1854-1869). His chief work is his translation
of Virgil's <i>&AElig;neid</i> in the octosyllabic metre of Scott (1861-68).
He also translated the <i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i> of Horace in Pope's

U.S. Navy, in which he remained for 3 years, an experience which
was of immense future value to him as an author. It was not until
1821 that his first novel, <i>Precaution</i>, appeared. Its want of success
<a name='Page_95'></a>did not discourage him, and in the next year (1822), he produced <i>The
Spy</i>, which at once gained him a high place as a story-teller. He wrote
over 30 novels, of which may be mentioned <i>The Pioneers</i> (1823), <i>The
Pilot</i> (1823), <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> (1826), <i>The Prairie</i> (1826), <i>The
Red Rover</i> (1831), <i>The Bravo</i> (1840), <i>The Pathfinder</i>, <i>The Deerslayer</i>
(1841), <i>The Two Admirals</i> (1842), and <i>Satanstoe</i> (1845). He also
wrote a <i>Naval History of the United States</i> (1839). C. was possessed
of remarkable narrative and descriptive powers, and could occasionally
delineate character. He had the merit of opening up an
entirely new field, and giving expression to the spirit of the New
World, but his true range was limited, and he sometimes showed a
lack of judgment in choosing subjects with which he was not fitted
to deal. He was a proud and combative but honest and estimable
man.</p><br />

became a leader and lecturer among the Chartists, and in 1842 was
imprisoned in Stafford gaol for two years, where he wrote his <i>Purgatory
of Suicides</i>, a political epic. At the same time he adopted
sceptical views, which he continued to hold until 1855, when he
became a Christian, joined the Baptists, and was a preacher among
them. In his latter years he settled down into an old-fashioned
Radical. His friends in 1867 raised an annuity for him, and in the last
year of his life he received a government pension. In addition to his
poems he wrote several novels. Somewhat impulsive, he was an

France, Italy, and Germany, walking nearly 2000 miles in one pair
of shoes, which were, until 1702, hung up in Odcombe Church, and
known as &quot;the thousand mile shoes.&quot; He gave an amusing account
of this in his <i>Coryate's Crudities hastily gobbled up</i> (1611), prefixed
to which were commendatory verses by many contemporary
poets. A sequel, <i>Coryate's Cramb&eacute;</i>, or <i>Colewort twice Sodden</i> followed.

Civil War he joined the Royalists, was turned out of his college, and
in 1646 followed the Queen to Paris, where he remained for 10 or 12
years, during which he rendered unwearied service to the royal
family. At the Restoration he wrote some loyal odes, but was
disappointed by being refused the Mastership of the Savoy, and
retired to the country. He received a lease of Crown lands, but his
life in the country did not yield him the happiness he expected. He
is said by Pope to have <i>d.</i> of a fever brought on by lying in the fields
after a drinking-bout. The drinking-bout, however, is perhaps an
ill-natured addition. C.'s fame among his contemporaries was
much greater than that which posterity has accorded to him. His
poems are marred by conceits and a forced and artificial brilliancy.
In some of them, however, he sings pleasantly of gardens and
country scenes. They comprise <i>Miscellanies</i>, <i>The Mistress, or Love
Poems</i> (1647), <i>Pindaric Odes</i>, and <i>The Davideis</i>, an epic on David
(unfinished). He is at his best in such imitations of Anacreon as
<i>The Grasshopper</i>. His prose, especially in his Essays, though now
almost unread, is better than his verse; simple and manly, it sometimes
rises to eloquence. C. is buried in Westminster Abbey near
Spenser.</p>

<a name='COWPER_WILLIAM_1731_1800'></a><p><b>COWPER, WILLIAM (1731-1800).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was the <i>s.</i> of the
Rev. John C., Rector of Great Berkhampstead, Herts, and Chaplain
to George II. His grandfather was a judge, and he was the grand-nephew
of the 1st Earl C., the eminent Lord Chancellor. A shy and
timid child, the death of his mother when he was 6 years old, and
the sufferings inflicted upon him by a bullying schoolfellow at his
first school, wounded his tender and shrinking spirit irrecoverably.
He was sent to Westminster School, where he had for schoolfellows
<a href='#CHURCHILL_CHARLES_1731_1764'>Churchill</a>, the poet (<i>q.v.</i>), and Warren Hastings. The powerful
legal influence of his family naturally suggested his being destined
for the law, and at 18 he entered the chambers of a solicitor, where
he had for a companion Thurlow, the future Chancellor, a truly incongruous
conjunction; the pair, however, seem to have got on well
together, and employed their time chiefly in &quot;giggling and making
giggle.&quot; He then entered the Middle Temple, and in 1754 was
called to the Bar. This was perhaps the happiest period of his life,
being enlivened by the society of two cousins, Theodora and Harriet
C. With the former he fell in love; but his proposal of marriage
was opposed by her <i>f.</i>, who had observed symptoms of morbidity in
him, and he never met her again. The latter, as Lady Hesketh, was
in later days one of his most intimate friends. In 1759 he received
a small sinecure appointment as Commissioner of Bankrupts,
which he held for 5 years, and in 1763, through the influence of a
relative, he received the offer of the desirable office of Clerk of the
Journals to the House of Lords. He accepted the appointment, but
the dread of having to make a formal appearance before the House
so preyed upon his mind as to induce a temporary loss of reason, and
he was sent to an asylum at St. Albans, where he remained for about
<a name='Page_98'></a>a year. He had now no income beyond a small sum inherited from
his <i>f.</i>, and no aims in life; but friends supplemented his means sufficiently
to enable him to lead with a quiet mind the life of retirement
which he had resolved to follow. He went to Huntingdon, and
there made the acquaintance of the Unwins, with whom he went to
live as a boarder. The acquaintance soon ripened into a close
friendship, and on the death, from an accident (1767), of Mr. U.,
C. accompanied his widow (the &quot;Mary&quot; of his poems) to Olney,
where the <a href='#NEWTON_JOHN_1725_1807'>Rev. John Newton</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) was curate. N. and C. became
intimate friends, and collaborated in producing the well-known
<i>Olney Hymns</i>, of which 67 were composed by C. He became engaged
to Mary Unwin, but a fresh attack of his mental malady in 1773
prevented their marriage. On his recovery he took to gardening,
and amused himself by keeping pets, including the hares &quot;Tiny&quot;
and &quot;Puss,&quot; and the spaniel &quot;Beau,&quot; immortalised in his works.
The chief means, however, which he adopted for keeping his mind
occupied and free from distressing ideas was the cultivation of his
poetic gift. At the suggestion of Mrs. U., he wrote <i>The Progress of
Error</i>; <i>Truth, Table Talk, Expostulation, Hope, Charity, Conversation</i>,
and <i>Retirement</i> were added, and the whole were <i>pub.</i> in one vol. in
1782. Though not received with acclamation, its signal merits of
freshness, simplicity, graceful humour, and the pure idiomatic
English in which it was written gradually obtained recognition, and
the fame of the poet-recluse began to spread. His health had now
become considerably re-established, and he enjoyed an unwonted
measure of cheerfulness, which was fostered by the friendship of
Lady Austin, who had become his neighbour. From her he received
the story of John Gilpin, which he forthwith turned into his immortal
ballad. Hers also was the suggestion that he should write a
poem in blank verse, which gave its origin to his most famous poem,
<i>The Task</i>. Before it was <i>pub.</i>, however, the intimacy had, apparently
owing to some little feminine jealousies, been broken off. <i>The
Task</i> was <i>pub.</i> in 1785, and met with immediate and distinguished
success. Although not formally or professedly, it was, in fact, the
beginning of an uprising against the classical school of poetry, and
the founding of a new school in which nature was the teacher. As
Dr. Stopford Brooke points out, &quot;Cowper is the first of the poets
who loves Nature entirely for her own sake,&quot; and in him &quot;the idea
of Mankind as a whole is fully formed.&quot; About this time he resumed
his friendship with his cousin, Lady Hesketh, and, encouraged
by her, he began his translation of <i>Homer</i>, which appeared in 1791.
Before this he had removed with Mrs. U. to the village of Weston
Underwood. His health had again given way; and in 1791 Mrs.
U. became paralytic, and the object of his assiduous and affectionate
care. A settled gloom with occasional brighter intervals was now
falling upon him. He strove to fight it by engaging in various translations,
and in revising his <i>Homer</i>, and undertaking a new ed. of
Milton, which last was, however, left unfinished. In 1794 a pension
of &pound;300 was conferred upon him, and in 1795 he removed with Mrs.
U., now a helpless invalid, to East Dereham. Mrs. U. <i>d.</i> in the
following year, and three years later his own death released him
from his heavy burden of trouble and sorrow. His last poem was
<i>The Castaway</i>, which, with its darkness almost of despair, shows no
<a name='Page_99'></a>loss of intellectual or poetic power. In addition to his reputation
as a poet C. has that of being among the very best of English letter-writers,
and in this he shows, in an even easier and more unstudied
manner, the same command of pure idiomatic English, the same
acute observation, and the same mingling of gentle humour and
melancholy. In literature C. is the connecting link between the
classical school of Pope and the natural school of Burns, Crabbe,
and Wordsworth, having, however, much more in common with the
latter.</p>

&mdash;Historian, was <i>b.</i> in London,
and <i>ed.</i> at Eton and Camb. As tutor to various young men of
family he travelled much on the Continent, and <i>pub.</i> accounts of his
journeys. His chief historical work is his <i>Memoirs of the House of
Austria</i> (1807), and he also wrote lives of Walpole, Marlborough,
and others. He had access to valuable original sources, and his
books, though somewhat heavy, are on the whole trustworthy, notwithstanding
a decided Whig bias. He was a clergyman, and <i>d.</i>
Archdeacon of Wilts.</p><br />

<a name='CRABBE_GEORGE_1754_1832'></a><p><b>CRABBE, GEORGE (1754-1832).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Aldborough,
Suffolk, where his <i>f.</i> was collector of salt dues, he was apprenticed to
a surgeon, but, having no liking for the work, went to London to
try his fortune in literature. Unsuccessful at first, he as a last
resource wrote a letter to Burke enclosing some of his writings, and
was immediately befriended by him, and taken into his own house,
where he met Fox, Reynolds, and others. His first important work,
<i>The Library</i>, was <i>pub.</i> in 1781, and received with favour. He took
orders, and was appointed by the Duke of Rutland his domestic
chaplain, residing with him at Belvoir Castle. Here in 1783 he <i>pub.
The Village</i>, which established his reputation, and about the same
time he was presented by Lord Thurlow to two small livings. He
was now secured from want, made a happy marriage, and devoted
himself to literary and scientific pursuits. The <i>Newspaper</i> appeared
in 1785, and was followed by a period of silence until 1807, when he
came forward again with <i>The Parish Register</i>, followed by <i>The
Borough</i> (1810), <i>Tales in Verse</i> (1812), and his last work, <i>Tales of the
Hall</i> (1817-18). In 1819 Murray the publisher gave him &pound;3000 for
the last named work and the unexpired copyright of his other
poems. In 1822 he visited Sir Walter Scott at Edinburgh. Soon
afterwards his health began to give way, and he <i>d.</i> in 1832. C. has
been called &quot;the poet of the poor.&quot; He describes in simple, but
strong and vivid, verse their struggles, sorrows, weaknesses, crimes,
and pleasures, sometimes with racy humour, oftener in sombre hues.<a name='Page_100'></a>
His pathos, sparingly introduced, goes to the heart; his pictures of
crime and despair not seldom rise to the terrific, and he has a
marvellous power of painting natural scenery, and of bringing out
in detail the beauty and picturesqueness of scenes at first sight uninteresting,
or even uninviting. He is absolutely free from affectation
or sentimentality, and may be regarded as one of the greatest
masters of the realistic in our literature. With these merits he has
certain faults, too great minuteness in his pictures, too frequent
dwelling upon the sordid and depraved aspects of character, and
some degree of harshness both in matter and manner, and not unfrequently
a want of taste.</p>

Prayer-book in fixing the language is his great, though indirect,
service to our literature.</p>

the style of Herbert; his <i>Weeping of the Magdalen</i> is full of the most
extravagant conceits, a fondness for which is, indeed, his besetting sin

&mdash;Poet and miscellaneous
writer, <i>b.</i> near Dalswinton, Dumfriesshire, in his youth
knew Burns, who was a friend of his father's. He was apprenticed
to a stonemason, but gave his leisure to reading and writing imitations
of old Scottish ballads, which he contributed to Cromek's
<i>Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1810, and which
gained for him the friendship of Scott and Hogg. Thereafter he
went to London, and became a parliamentary reporter, and subsequently
assistant to Chantrey, the sculptor, but continued his
literary labours, writing three novels, a life of Sir D. Wilkie, and
<i>Lives of Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</i>, besides
many songs, of which the best is <i>A wet sheet and a flowing Sea</i>. He
also brought out an ed. of Burns's Works. He had four sons, all of
whom rose to important positions, and inherited in some degree his
literary gifts.</p><br />

&mdash;American
essayist, editor, and journalist, contributed to <i>New York Tribune</i>,
and to <i>Putnam's</i> and <i>Harper's</i> monthlies, in which most of his
books first appeared. Among these are <i>Trumps</i>, a story of New
York life, <i>Prue and I</i>, <i>Lotus-eating</i>, and the <i>Potiphar Papers</i>. C.
was also one of the finest American orators of his day.</p><br />

<a name='CYNEWULF_fl_750'></a><p><b>CYNEWULF (<i>fl.</i> 750).</b>
&mdash;Anglo-Saxon poet. He was probably
a Northumbrian, though sometimes thought to have been a
Mercian. His poems, and some others, more or less doubtfully attributed
to him, are contained in the Exeter Book and the Vercelli
Book. The poems which are considered to be certainly his are the
<i>Riddles</i>, from hints and allusions in which is derived nearly all that is
known of him, or at least of the earlier part of his life, which appears
to have been that of a joyous and poetical nature, rejoicing in the
beauty of the world. His next poem, <i>Juliana</i>, the legend of a
virgin-martyr, indicates a transition in his spiritual life; sorrow and
repentance are its predominant notes, and in these respects another
poem, <i>St. Guthlac</i>, resembles it. In the <i>Crist</i> (Christ), C. has passed
through the clouds to an assured faith and peace. <i>The Ph&oelig;nix</i>,
and the second part of <i>Guthlac</i>, though not certainly his, are generally
attributed to him. <i>The Fates of the Apostles</i> and <i>Elene</i> (the legend
of St. Helena) are his; the <i>Andreas</i> and <i>The Dream of the Roode</i>
are still in some respects the subject of controversy. In several of
the poems the separate letters of C.'s name are introduced in a
peculiar manner, and are regarded as an attesting signature.
<i>Juliana</i>, <i>Crist</i>, <i>The Apostles</i>, and <i>Elene</i> are thus said to be signed.
The Exeter and Vercelli Books are collections of ancient English
poems, and they are named from the places where they were found.</p><br />

of survey and discovery (1699-1700), in the course of which he explored
the north-west coast of Australia and the coasts of New
Guinea and New Britain. In 1701 he was wrecked upon Ascension
Island, from which he was rescued by an East Indiaman. He was
afterwards court-martialled for cruelty, and wrote an angry but unconvincing

attached himself to the Court as a kind of voluntary laureate, and in
the reign of James I. was appointed &quot;Inspector of the children of the
Queen's revels,&quot; and a groom of the Queen's chamber. He is said
to have enjoyed the friendship of Shakespeare and Marlowe, but was
&quot;at jealousies&quot; with Ben Jonson. In his later years he retired to a

of the Civil Wars between York and Lancaster</i> in 8 books, <i>pub.</i> in
1604. His <i>Epistles</i> are generally considered his best work, and his
sonnets have had some modern admirers. Among his poems may
be mentioned the <i>Complaynt of Rosamund</i>, <i>Tethys Festival</i> (1610),
and <i>Hymen's Triumph</i> (1615), a masque, and <i>Musophilus</i>, a defence

&mdash;Poet, novelist, and
critic, <i>b.</i> at Dublin, and <i>ed.</i> at Trinity Coll. there, he early decided to
follow a literary career, and went to London, where he brought
out his first poem, <i>Errors of Ecstasie</i> (1822). He also wrote for
the <i>London Magazine</i>, under the pseudonym of John Lacy. In it
<a name='Page_106'></a>appeared his best story, <i>Lilian of the Vale</i>. Various other books
followed, including <i>Sylvia, or The May Queen</i>, a poem (1827).
Thereafter he joined the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, in which he showed himself a
severe critic. He was also a dramatist and a profound student of
old English plays, editing those of Beaumont and Fletcher in 1840.
So deeply was he imbued with the spirit of the 17th century that his
poem, &quot;It is not beauty I desire,&quot; was included by F.T. Palgrave in
the first ed. of his <i>Golden Treasury</i> as an anonymous lyric of that
age. He was also a mathematician of considerable talent, and <i>pub.</i>
some treatises on the subject. D. fell into nervous depression and

<a name='DARWIN_CHARLES_ROBERT_1809_1882'></a><p><b>DARWIN, CHARLES ROBERT (1809-1882).</b>
&mdash;Naturalist, <i>s.</i>
of a physician, and grandson of <a href='#DARWIN_ERASMUS_1731_1802'>Dr. Erasmus D.</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and of Josiah
Wedgwood, the famous potter, was <i>b.</i> and was at school at Shrewsbury.
In 1825 he went to Edin. to study medicine, but was more
taken up with marine zoology than with the regular curriculum. After
two years he proceeded to Camb., where he <i>grad.</i> in 1831, continuing,
however, his independent studies in natural history. In the same
year came the opportunity of his life, his appointment to accompany
the <i>Beagle</i> as naturalist on a survey of South America. To this
voyage, which extended over nearly five years, he attributed the
first real training of his mind, and after his return <i>pub.</i> an account
of it, <i>Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle</i> (1840). After spending a few
years in London arranging his collections and writing his <i>Journal</i>, he
removed to Down, a retired village near the Weald of Kent, where,
in a house surrounded by a large garden, his whole remaining life
was passed in the patient building up, from accurate observations,
of his theory of Evolution, which created a new epoch in science and
in thought generally. His industry was marvellous, especially
when it is remembered that he suffered from chronic bad health.
After devoting some time to geology, specially to coral reefs, and
exhausting the subject of barnacles, he took up the development
of his favourite question, the transformation of species. In these
earlier years of residence at Down he <i>pub.</i> <i>The Structure and Distribution
of Coral Reefs</i> (1842), and two works on the geology of
volcanic islands, and of South America. After he had given much
time and profound thought to the question of evolution by natural
selection, and had written out his notes on the subject, he received
in 1858 from <a href='#WALLACE_ALFRED_RUSSEL_FRS_LLD_etc_1823'>Mr. A.R. Wallace</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) a manuscript showing that he
also had reached independently a theory of the origin of species
similar to his own. This circumstance created a situation of considerable
delicacy and difficulty, which was ultimately got over by
the two discoverers presenting a joint paper, <i>On the Tendency of
Species to form Varieties</i>, and <i>On the Perpetuation of Varieties and
Species by Natural Means of Selection</i>. The publication in 1859 of
<i>The Origin of Species</i> gave D. an acknowledged place among the
greatest men of science, and the controversies which, along with
other of his works, it raised, helped to carry his name all over the
civilised world. Among his numerous subsequent writings may be
mentioned <i>The Fertilisation of Orchids</i> (1862), <i>Variation of Plants
and Animals under Domestication</i> (1868), <i>The Descent of Man, and
Selection in relation to Sex</i> (1871), <i>The Expression of the Emotions in<a name='Page_107'></a>
Man and Animals</i> (1872), <i>Insectivorous Plants</i> (1875), <i>Climbing
Plants</i> (1875), <i>Different Forms of Flowers</i> (1877), <i>The Power of
Movement in Plants</i> (1880), and <i>The Formation of Vegetable Mould
through the Action of Worms</i> (1881). D., with a modesty which was
one of his chief characteristics, disclaimed for himself the possession
of any remarkable talents except &quot;an unusual power of noticing
things which easily escape attention, and of observing them carefully.&quot;
In addition, however, to this peculiar insight, he had a
singular reverence for truth and fact, enormous industry, and great
self-abnegation: and his kindliness, modesty, and magnanimity
attracted the affection of all who knew him.</p>

where he took his degree of M.D. He ultimately settled in Lichfield
as a physician, and attained a high professional reputation, so
much so that he was offered, but declined, the appointment of
physician to George III. In 1778 he formed a botanical garden,
and in 1789 <i>pub.</i> his first poem, <i>The Loves of the Plants</i>, followed
in 1792 by <i>The Economy of Vegetation</i>, which combined form <i>The
Botanic Garden</i>. Another poem, <i>The Temple of Nature</i>, was <i>pub.</i>
posthumously. He also wrote various scientific works in prose.
The poems of D., though popular in their day, are now little read.
Written in polished and sonorous verse, they glitter with startling
similes and ingenious, though often forced, analogies, but have little
true poetry or human interest.</p><br />

several years Sec. to the British Embassy at Stockholm, where he
became interested in Scandinavian literature and mythology. Returning
to England he was appointed Assistant Ed. of <i>The Times</i>
(1845-1870). In 1852 he was called to the Bar, and in the following
year was appointed Prof. of English Literature and Modern History
at King's Coll., London, an office which he held for 13 years. He
was knighted in 1876. His principal writings have to do with Scandinavian
language, mythology, and folk-lore, and include an <i>Icelandic

Shakespeare was in the habit of visiting. This had some influence
on the future poet, who claimed to be Shakespeare's natural
<a name='Page_108'></a>son. D., <i>ed.</i> at Lincoln Coll., was afterwards in the service of
Lord Brooke, became involved in the troubles of the Civil War,
in which he took the Royalist side, and was imprisoned in the
Tower, escaped to France, and after returning was, in 1643,
knighted. Later D. was employed on various missions by the
King and Queen, was again in the Tower from 1650 to 1652,
when he <i>pub.</i> his poem <i>Gondibert</i>. He is said to have owed his
release to the interposition of Milton. In 1656 he practically
founded the English Opera by his <i>Siege of Rhodes</i> (1656). In 1659
he was again imprisoned, but after the Restoration he seems to
have enjoyed prosperity and Royal favour, and established a theatre,
where he was the first habitually to introduce female players and
movable scenery. D. wrote 25 dramatic pieces, among which are
<i>Albovine, King of the Lombards</i> (1629), <i>Platonick Lovers</i> (1636), <i>The
Wits</i> (1633), <i>Unfortunate Lovers</i> (1643), <i>Love and Honour</i> (1649).
None of them are now read; and the same may be said of <i>Gondibert</i>,
considered a masterpiece by contemporaries. D. succeeded Ben
Jonson as Poet Laureate, and collaborated with Dryden in altering
(and debasing) <i>The Tempest</i>. He <i>coll.</i> his miscellaneous verse under
the title of <i>Madagascar</i>. He is said to have had the satisfaction of
repaying in kind the good offices of Milton when the latter was in
danger in 1660. He joined with Waller and others in founding the

afterwards engaged in teaching at various places, and having taken
to literature went in 1890 to London. He achieved a reputation as
a writer of poems and plays of marked individuality and vivid
realism. His poems include <i>In a Music Hall</i> (1891), <i>Fleet Street

an enthusiasm for natural science, and continued to pursue his
studies when apprenticed in 1795 to a surgeon. He became specially
interested in chemistry, to which in 1797 he began more exclusively
to devote himself. Thereafter he assisted Dr. Beddoes in his
laboratory at Bristol, and entered upon his brilliant course of
chemical discovery. His <i>Researches, Chemical, and Philosophical</i>
(1799), led to his appointment as Director of the Chemical Laboratory
at the Royal Institution, where he also delivered courses of scientific
lectures with extraordinary popularity. Thereafter his life was a
succession of scientific triumphs and honours. His great discovery
was that of the metallic bases of the earths and alkalis. He also
discovered various metals, including sodium, calcium, and magnesium.
In 1812 he was knighted, and <i>m.</i> a wealthy widow. Thereafter
he investigated volcanic action and fire-damp, and invented
the safety lamp. In 1818 he was <i>cr.</i> a baronet, and in 1820 became
Pres. of the Royal Society, to which he communicated his discoveries
in electro-magnetism. In addition to his scientific writings, which
include <i>Elements of Agricultural Chemistry</i> (1813), and <i>Chemical
Agencies of Electricity</i>, he wrote <i>Salmonia, or Days of Fly Fishing</i>
(1828), somewhat modelled upon Walton, and <i>Consolations in
Travel</i> (1830), dialogues on ethical and religious questions. D.
sustained an apoplectic seizure in 1826, after which his health was
much impaired, and after twice wintering in Italy, he <i>d.</i> at Geneva,
where he received a public funeral. Though not attached to any

not practise. He became a disciple of Rousseau in his social views,
and endeavoured to put them in practice in combination with better
morality. He was a benevolent eccentric, and used his income,
which was increased by his marriage with an heiress, in schemes of
social reform as he understood it. He is chiefly remembered as the

&mdash;Journalist and novelist, <i>s.</i> of a butcher
in St. Giles, where he was <i>b.</i> His <i>f.</i> being a Dissenter,
he was <i>ed.</i> at a Dissenting coll. at Newington with the view of
becoming a Presbyterian minister. He joined the army of Monmouth,
and on its defeat was fortunate enough to escape punishment. In
1688 he joined William III. Before settling down to his career as a
political writer, D. had been engaged in various enterprises as a
hosier, a merchant-adventurer to Spain and Portugal, and a brickmaker,
all of which proved so unsuccessful that he had to fly from
his creditors. Having become known to the government as an
effective writer, and employed by them, he was appointed Accountant
in the Glass-Duty Office, 1659-1699. Among his more important
political writings are an <i>Essay on Projects</i> (1698), and <i>The
True-born Englishman</i> (1701), which had a remarkable success. In
1702 appeared <i>The Shortest Way with the Dissenters</i>, written in a
strain of grave irony which was, unfortunately for the author,
misunderstood, and led to his being fined, imprisoned, and put in the
pillory, which suggested his <i>Hymns to the Pillory</i> (1704).
Notwithstanding the disfavour with the government which these disasters
implied, D.'s knowledge of commercial affairs and practical ability
were recognised by his being sent in 1706 to Scotland to aid in the
Union negotiations. In the same year <i>Jure Divino</i>, a satire,
followed by a <i>History of the Union</i> (1709), and <i>The Wars of
Charles XII.</i> (1715). Further misunderstandings and disappointments in
connection with political matters led to his giving up this line of
activity, and, fortunately for posterity, taking to fiction. The first
and greatest of his novels, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, appeared in 1719, and
its sequel (of greatly inferior interest) in 1720. These were followed
by <i>Captain Singleton</i> (1720), <i>Moll Flanders</i>, <i>Colonel Jacque</i>, and
<i>Journal of the Plague Year</i> (1722), <i>Memoirs of a Cavalier</i> (1724), <i>A
New Voyage Round the World</i> (1725), and <i>Captain Carlton</i> (1728).
Among his miscellaneous works are <i>Political History of the Devil</i>
(1726), <i>System of Magic</i> (1727), <i>The Complete English Tradesman</i>
(1727), and <i>The Review</i>, a paper which he ed. In all he <i>pub.</i>,
including pamphlets, etc., about 250 works. All D.'s writings are
distinguished by a clear, nervous style, and his works of fiction by a
<a name='Page_111'></a>minute verisimilitude and naturalness of incident which has never
been equalled except perhaps by Swift, whose genius his, in some
other respects, resembled. The only description of his personal
appearance is given in an advertisement intended to lead to his
apprehension, and runs, &quot;A middle-sized, spare man about forty
years old, of a brown complexion, and dark brown-coloured hair,
but wears a wig; a hooked nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large
mole near his mouth.&quot; His mind was a peculiar amalgam of
imagination and matter-of-fact, seeing strongly and clearly what he
did see, but little conscious, apparently, of what lay outside his purview.</p>

<a name='DEKKER_THOMAS_1570_1641'></a><p><b>DEKKER, THOMAS (1570?-1641?).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist and miscellaneous
writer, was <i>b.</i> in London. Few details of D.'s life have
come down to us, though he was a well-known writer in his day,
and is believed to have written or contributed to over 20 dramas.
He collaborated at various times with several of his fellow-dramatists,
including Ben Jonson. Ultimately Jonson quarrelled with
Marston and D., satirising them in <i>The Poetaster</i> (1601), to which D.
replied in <i>Satiromastix</i> (1602). D.'s best play is <i>Old Fortunatus</i> (1606),
others are <i>The Shoemaker's Holiday</i> (1600), <i>Honest Whore</i> (1604),
<i>Roaring Girl</i> (1611), <i>The Virgin Martyr</i> (1622) (with Massinger), and
<i>The Witch of Edmonton</i> (1658) (with Ford and Rowley), <i>History of
Sir Thomas Wyat</i>, <i>Westward Ho</i>, and <i>Northward Ho</i>, all with Webster.
His prose writings include <i>The Gull's Hornbook</i> (1609), <i>The Seven
Deadly Sins of London</i>, and <i>The Belman of London</i> (1608), satirical
works which give interesting glimpses of the life of his time. His
life appears to have been a somewhat chequered one, alternating
between revelry and want. He is one of the most poetical of the
older dramatists. Lamb said he &quot;had poetry enough for anything.&quot;</p><br />

&mdash;Political writer,
<i>b.</i> at Geneva, has a place in English literature for his well-known
work, <i>The Constitution of England</i>, written in French, and translated
into English in 1775. He also wrote a comparison of the
English Government with that of Sweden, a <i>History of the Flagellants</i>
(1777), and <i>The British Empire in Europe</i> (1787). He came
to England in 1769, lived in great poverty, and having inherited a
small fortune, returned to his native place in 1775.</p><br />

<a name='DELONEY_THOMAS_1543_1600'></a><p><b>DELONEY, THOMAS (1543-1600).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and balladist,<br />
appears to have worked as a silk-weaver in Norwich, but was in
London by 1586, and in the course of the next 10 years is known to
have written about 50 ballads, some of which involved him in
trouble, and caused him to lie <i>perdue</i> for a time. It is only recently
that his more important work as a novelist, in which he ranks with
Greene and Nash, has received attention. He appears to have
turned to this new field of effort when his original one was closed to
him for the time. Less under the influence of Lyly and other preceding
writers than Greene, he is more natural, simple, and direct,
and writes of middle-class citizens and tradesmen with a light and
<a name='Page_112'></a>pleasant humour. Of his novels, <i>Thomas of Reading</i> is in honour of
clothiers, <i>Jack of Newbury</i> celebrates weaving, and <i>The Gentle
Craft</i> is dedicated to the praise of shoemakers. He &quot;dy'd poorely,&quot;
but was &quot;honestly buried.&quot;</p><br />

in India, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., was one of the most brilliant of English
mathematicians. He is mentioned here in virtue of his <i>Budget of

which mathematical fallacies are discussed with sparkling wit, and

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of the Chief
Baron of Exchequer in Ireland, was <i>b.</i> in Dublin, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf.
He began his literary career with a tragedy, <i>The Sophy</i> (1641), which
seldom rises above mediocrity. His poem, <i>Cooper's Hill</i> (1642), is
the work by which he is remembered. It is the first example in
English of a poem devoted to local description. D. received extravagant
praise from Johnson; but the place now assigned him is
a much more humble one. His verse is smooth, clear, and agreeable,
and occasionally a thought is expressed with remarkable
terseness and force. In his earlier years D. suffered for his
Royalism; but after the Restoration enjoyed prosperity. He,
however, made an unhappy marriage, and his last years were
clouded by insanity. He was an architect by profession, coming
between Inigo Jones and Wren as King's Surveyor.</p><br />

<a name='DENNIS_JOHN_1657_1734'></a><p><b>DENNIS, JOHN (1657-1734).</b>
&mdash;Critic, etc., <i>s.</i> of a saddler,
was <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i> at Harrow and Caius Coll., Camb., from
the latter of which he was expelled for stabbing a fellow-student, and
transferred himself to Trinity Hall. He attached himself to the
Whigs, in whose interest he wrote several bitter and vituperative
pamphlets. His attempts at play-writing were failures; and he
then devoted himself chiefly to criticising the works of his contemporaries.
In this line, while showing some acuteness, he aroused
much enmity by his ill-temper and jealousy. Unfortunately for
him, some of those whom he attacked, such as Pope and Swift, had
the power of conferring upon him an unenviable immortality.
Embalmed in <i>The Dunciad</i>, his name has attained a fame which no
work of his own could have given it. Of Milton, however, he
showed a true appreciation. Among his works are <i>Rinaldo and
Armida</i> (1699), <i>Appius and Virginia</i> (1709), <i>Reflections Critical
and Satirical</i> (1711), and <i>Three Letters on Shakespeare</i>. He <i>d.</i> in

<a name='DE_QUINCEY_THOMAS_1785_1859'></a><p><b>DE QUINCEY, THOMAS (1785-1859).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and miscellaneous
writer, <i>s.</i> of a merchant in Manchester, was <i>b.</i> there. The
aristocratic &quot;De&quot; was assumed by himself, his <i>f.</i>, whom he lost
while he was still a child, having been known by the name of Quincey,
and he claimed descent from a Norman family. His <i>Autobiographic
Sketches</i> give a vivid picture of his early years at the family
residence of Greenheys, and show him as a highly imaginative and
over-sensitive child, suffering hard things at the hands of a tyrannical
elder brother. He was <i>ed.</i> first at home, then at Bath Grammar<a name='Page_113'></a>
School, next at a private school at Winkfield, Wilts, and in 1801 he
was sent to the Manchester Grammar School, from which he ran
away, and for some time rambled in Wales on a small allowance
made to him by his mother. Tiring of this, he went to London in
the end of 1802, where he led the strange Bohemian life related in
<i>The Confessions</i>. His friends, thinking it high time to interfere,
sent him in 1803 to Oxf., which did not, however, preclude occasional
brief interludes in London, on one of which he made his first
acquaintance with opium, which was to play so prominent and
disastrous a part in his future life. In 1807 he became acquainted with
Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Southey, and soon afterwards with C.
Lamb. During the years 1807-9 he paid various visits to the Lakes,
and in the latter year he settled at Townend, Grasmere, where
Wordsworth had previously lived. Here he pursued his studies,
becoming gradually more and more enslaved by opium, until in 1813
he was taking from 8000 to 12,000 drops daily. John Wilson
(Christopher North), who was then living at Elleray, had become
his friend, and brought him to Edinburgh occasionally, which ended
in his passing the latter part of his life in that city. His marriage
to Margaret Simpson, <i>dau.</i> of a farmer, took place in 1816. Up to
this time he had written nothing, but had been steeping his mind in
German metaphysics, and out-of-the-way learning of various kinds;
but in 1819 he sketched out <i>Prolegomena of all future Systems of
Political Economy</i>, which, however, was never finished. In the same
year he acted as ed. of the <i>Westmoreland Gazette</i>. His true literary
career began in 1821 with the publication in the <i>London Magazine</i>
of <i>The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>. Thereafter he produced
a long series of articles, some of them almost on the scale of
books, in <i>Blackwood's</i> and <i>Tait's</i> magazines, the <i>Edinburgh Literary
Gazette</i>, and <i>Hogg's Instructor</i>. These included <i>Murder considered
as one of the Fine Arts</i> (1827), and in his later and more important
period, <i>Suspiria De Profundis</i> (1845), <i>The Spanish Military Nun</i>
(1847), <i>The English Mail-Coach</i>, and <i>Vision of Sudden Death</i> (1849).
In 1853 he began a <i>coll.</i> ed. of his works, which was the main occupation
of his later years. He had in 1830 brought his family to
Edinburgh, which, except for two years, 1841-43, when he lived in
Glasgow, was his home till his death in 1859, and in 1837, on his
wife's death, he placed them in the neighbouring village of Lasswade,
while he lived in solitude, moving about from one dingy lodging to
another.</p>

<p>De Q. stands among the great masters of style in the language.
In his greatest passages, as in the <i>Vision of Sudden Death</i> and the
<i>Dream Fugue</i>, the cadence of his elaborately piled-up sentences falls
like cathedral music, or gives an abiding expression to the fleeting
pictures of his most gorgeous dreams. His character unfortunately
bore no correspondence to his intellectual endowments. His moral
system had in fact been shattered by indulgence in opium. His
appearance and manners have been thus described: &quot;A short and
fragile, but well-proportioned frame; a shapely and compact head;
a face beaming with intellectual light, with rare, almost feminine
beauty of feature and complexion; a fascinating courtesy of
manner, and a fulness, swiftness, and elegance of silvery speech.&quot;

Manning, and in 1851 was received into the Church of Rome. He
was the author of many vols. of poetry, including <i>The Waldenses</i>
(1842), <i>The Search for Proserpine</i> (1843), etc. In 1861 he began a
series of poems on Irish subjects, <i>Inisfail</i>, <i>The Infant Bridal</i>, <i>Irish
Odes</i>, etc. His interest in Ireland and its people led him to write
prose works, including <i>English Misrule and Irish Misdeeds</i> (1848);
and to criticism he contributed <i>Essays chiefly on Poetry</i> (1887). His
last work was his <i>Recollections</i> (1897). His poetry is characterised
by lofty ethical tone, imaginative power, and grave stateliness of
expression.</p><br />

&mdash;Dramatist and song
writer, <i>b.</i> at Southampton, began his literary career at 16 with a
drama, <i>The Shepherd's Artifice</i>. His fame, however, rests on his
sea songs, which are unrivalled, and include <i>Tom Bowling</i>, <i>Poor
Jack</i>, and <i>Blow High Blow Low</i>. He is said to have written over
1200 of these, besides many dramatic pieces and two novels, <i>Hannah

Stage</i> (1795).</p><br />

<a name='DICKENS_CHARLES_1812_1870'></a><p><b>DICKENS, CHARLES (1812-1870).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i> at Landport,
near Portsmouth, where his <i>f.</i> was a clerk in the Navy Pay-Office.
The hardships and mortifications of his early life, his want
of regular schooling, and his miserable time in the blacking factory,
which form the basis of the early chapters of <i>David Copperfield</i>, are
largely accounted for by the fact that his <i>f.</i> was to a considerable
extent the prototype of the immortal Mr. Micawber; but partly by
his being a delicate and sensitive child, unusually susceptible to
suffering both in body and mind. He had, however, much time for
reading, and had access to the older novelists, Fielding, Smollett,
and others. A kindly relation also took him frequently to the
theatre, where he acquired his life-long interest in, and love of, the
stage. After a few years' residence in Chatham, the family removed to
London, and soon thereafter his <i>f.</i> became an inmate of the Marshalsea,
in which by-and-by the whole family joined him, a passage in
his life which furnishes the material for parts of <i>Little Dorrit</i>. This
period of family obscuration happily lasted but a short time: the
elder D. managed to satisfy his creditors, and soon after retired
from his official duties on a pension. About the same time D. had
two years of continuous schooling, and shortly afterwards he entered
<a name='Page_115'></a>a law office. His leisure he devoted to reading and learning shorthand,
in which he became very expert. He then acted as parliamentary
reporter, first for <i>The True Sun</i>, and from 1835 for the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>. Meanwhile he had been contributing to the <i>Monthly
Magazine</i> and the <i>Evening Chronicle</i> the papers which, in 1836,
appeared in a <i>coll.</i> form as <i>Sketches by Boz</i>; and he had also produced
one or two comic burlettas. In the same year he <i>m.</i> Miss Ann
Hogarth; and in the following year occurred the opportunity of his
life. He was asked by Chapman and Hall to write the letterpress
for a series of sporting plates to be done by Robert Seymour who,
however, <i>d.</i> shortly after, and was succeeded by Hablot Browne
(Phiz), who became the illustrator of most of D.'s novels. In the hands
of D. the original plan was entirely altered, and became the <i>Pickwick
Papers</i> which, appearing in monthly parts during 1837-39, took the
country by storm. Simultaneously <i>Oliver Twist</i> was coming out in
<i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>. Thenceforward D.'s literary career was a
continued success, and the almost yearly publication of his works
constituted the main events of his life. <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> appeared
in serial form 1838-39. Next year he projected <i>Master Humphrey's
Clock</i>, intended to be a series of miscellaneous stories and sketches.
It was, however, soon abandoned, <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> and
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i> taking its place. The latter, dealing with the
Gordon Riots, is, with the partial exception of the <i>Tale of Two
Cities</i>, the author's only excursion into the historical novel. In
1841 D. went to America, and was received with great enthusiasm,
which, however, the publication of <i>American Notes</i> considerably
damped, and the appearance of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> in 1843, with its
caustic criticisms of certain features of American life, converted
into extreme, though temporary, unpopularity. The first of the
Christmas books&mdash;the <i>Christmas Carol</i>&mdash;appeared in 1843, and in
the following year D. went to Italy, where at Genoa he wrote <i>The
Chimes</i>, followed by <i>The Cricket on the Hearth</i>, <i>The Battle of Life</i>,
and <i>The Haunted Man</i>. In January, 1846, he was appointed first
ed. of <i>The Daily News</i>, but resigned in a few weeks. The same year
he went to Switzerland, and while there wrote <i>Dombey and Son</i>,
which was <i>pub.</i> in 1848, and was immediately followed by his
masterpiece, <i>David Copperfield</i> (1849-50). Shortly before this he
had become manager of a theatrical company, which performed in
the provinces, and he had in 1849 started his magazine, <i>Household
Words</i>. <i>Bleak House</i> appeared in 1852-53, <i>Hard Times</i> in 1854, and
<i>Little Dorrit</i> 1856-57. In 1856 he bought Gadshill Place, which, in
1860, became his permanent home. In 1858 he began his public readings
from his works, which, while eminently successful from a financial
point of view, from the nervous strain which they entailed,
gradually broke down his constitution, and hastened his death. In
the same year he separated from his wife, and consequent upon the
controversy which arose thereupon he brought <i>Household Words</i> to
an end, and started <i>All the Year Round</i>, in which appeared <i>A Tale
of Two Cities</i> (1859), and <i>Great Expectations</i> (1860-61). <i>Our Mutual
Friend</i> came out in numbers (1864-65). D. was now in the full tide
of his readings, and decided to give a course of them in America.
Thither accordingly he went in the end of 1867, returning in the
following May. He had a magnificent reception, and his profits
<a name='Page_116'></a>amounted to &pound;20,000; but the effect on his health was such that he
was obliged, on medical advice, finally to abandon all appearances
of the kind. In 1869 he began his last work, <i>The Mystery of Edwin
Drood</i>, which was interrupted by his death from an apoplectic
seizure on June 8, 1870.</p>

<p>One of D.'s most marked characteristics is the extraordinary
wealth of his invention as exhibited in the number and variety of
the characters introduced into his novels. Another, especially, of
course, in his entire works, is his boundless flow of animal spirits.
Others are his marvellous keenness of observation and his descriptive
power. And the English race may well, with Thackeray, be
&quot;grateful for the innocent laughter, and the sweet and unsullied
pages which the author of <i>David Copperfield</i> gives to [its]
children.&quot; On the other hand, his faults are obvious, a tendency
to caricature, a mannerism that often tires, and almost disgusts, fun
often forced, and pathos not seldom degenerating into mawkishness.
But at his best how rich and genial is the humour, how
tender often the pathos. And when all deductions are made, he had
the laughter and tears of the English-speaking world at command
for a full generation while he lived, and that his spell still works is
proved by a continuous succession of new editions.</p>

time he wrote a <i>Life of Peace</i> (1851), in answer to Macaulay's onslaught.
Lives of <i>Admiral Blake</i> and <i>Lord Bacon</i> followed, which
received somewhat severe criticisms at the hands of competent

include <i>Her Majesty's Tower</i>, and <i>The History of Two Queens</i>
(Catherine of Arragon and Anne Boleyn). Though a diligent
student of original authorities, and sometimes successful in throwing
fresh light on his subjects, D. was not always accurate, and thus
laid himself open to criticism; and his book, <i>Spiritual Wives</i>, treating
of Mormonism, was so adversely criticised as to lead to an action.
He wrote, however, in a fresh and interesting style. He was one of

which, however, was damaged by a fall while exploring some ruins
<a name='Page_118'></a>at Pozzuoli. D.'s poems exhibit fancy and brilliancy of diction, but
want simplicity, and sometimes run into grandiloquence and other
faults of the so-called spasmodic school to which he belonged.</p><br />

but, acquiring expensive habits, got involved in hopeless difficulties,
from which he endeavoured to escape first by an attempted
simoniacal transaction, for which he was disgraced, and then by
forging a bond for &pound;4200, for which, according to the then existing
law, he was hanged. Great efforts were made to obtain a commutation
of the sentence, and Dr. Johnson wrote one of the petitions,
but on D.'s book, <i>Thoughts in Prison</i>, appearing posthumously, he
remarked that &quot;a man who has been canting all his days may cant

While thus engaged he produced <i>The Muse in Livery</i> (1732). This
was followed by <i>The Toy Shop</i>, a drama, which brought him under
the notice of Pope, who befriended him, and assisted him in starting
business as a bookseller. In this he became eminently successful, and
acted as publisher for Pope, Johnson, and Akenside. He projected
and <i>pub.</i> <i>The Annual Register</i>, and made a collection of <i>Old English
Plays</i>, also of <i>Poems by Several Hands</i> in 6 vols. In addition to the

Roman Catholic, he was sent to Oxf. and Camb., and afterwards
entered Lincoln's Inn with a view to the law. Here he studied the
points of controversy between Romanists and Protestants, with the
result that he joined the Church of England. The next two years
were somewhat changeful, including travels on the Continent,
service as a private sec., and a clandestine marriage with the niece
of his patron, which led to dismissal and imprisonment, followed by
reconciliation. On the suggestion of James I., who approved of
<i>Pseudo-Martyr</i> (1610), a book against Rome which he had written,
he took orders, and after executing a mission to Bohemia, he was,
in 1621, made Dean of St. Paul's. D. had great popularity as a
preacher. His works consist of elegies, satires, epigrams, and
religious pieces, in which, amid many conceits and much that is
artificial, frigid, and worse, there is likewise much poetry and
imagination of a high order. Perhaps the best of his works is <i>An
Anatomy of the World</i> (1611), an elegy. Others are <i>Epithalamium</i>
(1613), <i>Progress of the Soul</i> (1601), and <i>Divine Poems</i>. Collections
of his poems appeared in 1633 and 1649. He exercised a
strong influence on literature for over half a century after his death;
to him we owe the unnatural style of conceits and overstrained
efforts after originality of the succeeding age.</p><br />

He was, however, a patron of literature, and a benefactor of Dryden
in his later and less prosperous years. He wrote a few satires and

in conjunction with Thomas Norton, <i>Ferren and Porrex</i> or <i>Gerboduc</i>
(1561-2), the first regular English tragedy. A little later he planned
<i>The Mirror for Magistrates</i>, which was to have been a series of narratives
of distinguished Englishmen, somewhat on the model of
Boccaccio's <i>Falls of Princes</i>. Finding the plan too large, he handed
it over to others&mdash;seven poets in all being engaged upon it&mdash;and
himself contributed two poems only, one on <i>Buckingham</i>, the confederate,
<a name='Page_120'></a>and afterwards the victim, of Richard III., and an <i>Induction</i>
or introduction, which constitute nearly the whole value of the
work. In these poems S. becomes the connecting link between
Chaucer and Spenser. They are distinguished by strong invention
and imaginative power, and a stately and sombre grandeur of style.
S. played a prominent part in the history of his time, and held many
high offices, including those of Lord Steward and Lord Treasurer,
the latter of which he held from 1599 till his death. It fell to him
to announce to Mary Queen of Scots the sentence of death.</p><br />

Church. Promotion came early, and he was in 1501 made Provost
of St. Giles, Edin., and in 1514 Abbot of Aberbrothock, and Archbishop
of St. Andrews. But the times were troublous, and he had
hardly received these latter preferments when he was deprived of
them. He was, however, named Bishop of Dunkeld in 1514 and,
after some difficulty, and undergoing imprisonment, was confirmed
in the see. In 1520 he was again driven forth, and two years later
<i>d.</i> of the plague in London. His principal poems are <i>The Palace of
Honour</i> (1501), and <i>King Hart</i>, both allegorical; but his great
achievement was his translation of the <i>&AElig;neid</i> in ten-syllabled
metre, the first translation into English of a classical work. D.'s
language is more archaic than that of some of his predecessors, his
rhythm is rough and unequal, but he had fire, and a power of vivid
description, and his allegories are ingenious and felicitous.</p>

work is his ballads, which include <i>The Red Thread of Honour</i>, <i>The

<a name='DRAYTON_MICHAEL_1563_1631'></a><p><b>DRAYTON, MICHAEL (1563-1631).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Warwickshire,
was in early life page to a gentleman, and was possibly at
Camb. or Oxf. His earliest poem, <i>The Harmonie of the Church</i>, was
destroyed. His next was <i>The Shepherd's Garland</i> (1593), afterwards
reprinted as <i>Eclogues</i>. Three historical poems, <i>Gaveston</i>
(1593), <i>Matilda</i> (1594), and <i>Robert, Duke of Normandie</i> (1596)
followed, and he then appears to have collaborated with Dekker,
Webster, and others in dramatic work. His <i>magnum opus</i>, however,
was <i>Polyolbion</i> (1613?), a topographical description of England
in twelve-syllabled verse, full of antiquarian and historical details,
so accurate as to make the work an authority on such matters.
The rushing verse is full of vigour and gusto. Other poems of D. are
<i>The Wars of the Barons</i> (1603), <i>England's Heroical Epistles</i> (1598)
(being imaginary letters between Royal lovers such as Henry II.
and Rosamund), <i>Poems, Lyric and Heroic</i> (1606) (including the fine
ballad of &quot;Agincourt&quot;), <i>Nymphidia</i>, his most graceful work, <i>Muses
Elizium</i>, and <i>Idea's Mirrour</i>, a collection of sonnets, Idea being the
name of the lady to whom they were addressed. Though often
heavy, D. had the true poetic gift, had passages of grandeur, and
sang the praises of England with the heart of a patriot.</p><br />

&mdash;Theological and
scientific writer, <i>b.</i> at Stirling, and <i>ed.</i> at Edin., he studied for the
ministry of the Free Church. Having a decided scientific bent he
gave himself specially to the study of geology, and made a scientific
tour in the Rocky Mountains with Sir A. Geikie. Some years later
he undertook a geological exploration of Lake Nyassa and the
neighbouring country for the African Lakes Corporation, and
brought home a valuable Report. He also <i>pub.</i> <i>Tropical Africa</i>, a
vivid account of his travels. He became much associated with the
American evangelist, D.L. Moody, and became an extremely effective
speaker on religious subjects, devoting himself specially to young
men. His chief contribution to literature was his <i>Natural Law in
the Spiritual World</i>, which had extraordinary popularity. <i>The
Ascent of Man</i> was less successful. D. was a man of great personal
fascination, and wrote in an interesting and suggestive manner, but
his reasoning in his scientific works was by no means unassailable.</p><br />

<a name='DRUMMOND_WILLIAM_1585_1649'></a><p><b>DRUMMOND, WILLIAM (1585-1649).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was descended
from a very ancient family, and through Annabella D., Queen of
Robert III., related to the Royal House. <i>Ed.</i> at Edin. Univ., he
studied law on the Continent, but succeeding in 1610 to his paternal
estate of Hawthornden, he devoted himself to poetry. <i>Tears on the
Death of Meliades</i> (Prince Henry) appeared in 1613, and in 1616
<i>Poems, Amorous, Funerall, Divine, etc.</i> His finest poem, <i>Forth
Feasting</i> (1617), is addressed to James VI. on his revisiting Scotland.
D. was also a prose-writer, and composed a <i>History of the
Five Jameses, Kings of Scotland from 1423-1524</i>, and <i>The Cypress
Grove</i>, a meditation on death. He was also a mechanical genius,
and patented 16 inventions. D., though a Scotsman, wrote in the
classical English of the day, and was the friend of his principal
<a name='Page_122'></a>literary contemporaries, notably of Ben Jonson, who visited him at
Hawthornden, on which occasion D. preserved notes of his conversations,
not always flattering. For this he has received much blame,
but it must be remembered that he did not <i>pub.</i> them. As a poet
he belonged to the school of Spenser. His verse is sweet, flowing,
and harmonious. He excelled as a writer of sonnets, one of which,
on <i>John the Baptist</i>, has a suggestion of Milton.</p>

<a name='DRYDEN_JOHN_1631_1700'></a><p><b>DRYDEN, JOHN (1631-1700).</b>
&mdash;Poet, dramatist, and
satirist, was <i>b.</i> at Aldwincle Rectory, Northamptonshire. His <i>f.</i>,
from whom he inherited a small estate, was Erasmus, 3rd <i>s.</i> of Sir
Erasmus Driden; his mother was Mary Pickering, also of good family;
both families belonged to the Puritan side in politics and religion.
He was <i>ed.</i> at Westminster School and Trinity Coll., Camb., and
thereafter, in 1657, came to London. While at coll. he had written
some not very successful verse. His <i>Heroic Stanzas on the Death of
Oliver Cromwell</i> (1658) was his first considerable poem. It was
followed, in 1660, by <i>Astr&aelig;a Redux</i>, in honour of the Restoration.
The interval of 18 months had been crowded with events, and
though much has been written against his apparent change of
opinion, it is fair to remember that the whole cast of his mind led
him to be a supporter of <i>de facto</i> authority. In 1663 he <i>m.</i> Lady
Elizabeth Howard, <i>dau.</i> of the Earl of Berkshire. The Restoration
introduced a revival of the drama in its most debased form, and for
many years D. was a prolific playwright, but though his vigorous
powers enabled him to work effectively in this department, as in
every other in which he engaged, it was not his natural line, and
happily his fame does not rest upon his plays, which are deeply
stained with the immorality of the age. His first effort, <i>The Wild
Gallant</i> (1663), was a failure; his next, <i>The Rival Ladies</i>, a tragi-comedy,
established his reputation, and among his other dramas
may be mentioned <i>The Indian Queene</i>, <i>Amboyna</i> (1673), <i>Tyrannic
Love</i> (1669), <i>Almanzar and Almahide</i> (ridiculed in Buckingham's
<i>Rehearsal</i>) (1670), <i>Arungzebe</i> (1675), <i>All for Love</i> (an adaptation of
Shakespeare's <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>) (1678). During the great
plague, 1665, D. left London, and lived with his father-in-law at
Charleton. On his return he <i>pub.</i> his first poem of real power,
<i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, of which the subjects were the great fire, and the
Dutch War. In 1668 appeared his <i>Essay on Dramatic Poetry</i> in the
form of a dialogue, fine alike as criticism and as prose. Two years
later (1670) he became Poet Laureate and Historiographer Royal with
a pension of &pound;300 a year. D. was now in prosperous circumstances,
having received a portion with his wife, and besides the salaries of
his appointments, and his profits from literature, holding a valuable
share in the King's play-house. In 1671 G. Villiers, Duke of Buckingham,
produced his <i>Rehearsal</i>, in ridicule of the overdone heroics
of the prevailing drama, and satirising D. as Mr. Bayes. To this D.
made no immediate reply, but bided his time. The next years were
devoted to the drama. But by this time public affairs were assuming
a critical aspect. A large section of the nation was becoming
alarmed at the prospect of the succession of the Duke of York, and
<a name='Page_123'></a>a restoration of popery, and Shaftesbury was supposed to be promoting
the claims of the Duke of Monmouth. And now D. showed;
his full powers. The first part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> appeared
in 1681, in which Charles figures as &quot;David,&quot; Shaftesbury as
&quot;Achitophel,&quot; Monmouth as &quot;Absalom,&quot; Buckingham as &quot;Zimri,&quot;
in the short but crushing delineation of whom the attack of the
<i>Rehearsal</i> was requited in the most ample measure. The effect;
of the poem was tremendous. Nevertheless the indictment against
Shaftesbury for high treason was ignored by the Grand Jury at
the Old Bailey, and in honour of the event a medal was struck,
which gave a title to D.'s next stroke. His <i>Medal</i> was issued in
1682. The success of these wonderful poems raised a storm round
D. Replies were forthcoming in Elkanah Settle's <i>Absalom and
Achitophel Transposed</i>, and Pordage's <i>Azaria and Hushai</i>. These
compositions, especially Pordage's, were comparatively moderate.
Far otherwise was Shadwell's <i>Medal of John Bayes</i>, one of the most
brutal and indecent pieces in the language. D.'s revenge&mdash;and an
ample one&mdash;was the publication of <i>MacFlecknoe</i>, a satire in which
all his opponents, but especially Shadwell, were held up to the
loathing and ridicule of succeeding ages, and others had conferred,
upon them an immortality which, however unenviable, no efforts of
their own could have secured for them. Its immediate effect was
to crush and silence all his assailants. The following year, 1683,
saw the publication of <i>Religio Laici</i> (the religion of a layman). In
1686 D. joined the Church of Rome, for which he has by some been
blamed for time-serving of the basest kind. On the other hand his
consistency and conscientiousness have by others been as strongly
maintained. The change, which was announced by the publication,
in 1687 of <i>The Hind and the Panther, a Defence of the Roman Church</i>,
at all events did not bring with it any worldly advantages. It was
parodied by C. Montague and Prior in the <i>Town and Country Mouse</i>.
At the Revolution D. was deprived of all his pensions and appointments,
including the Laureateship, in which he was succeeded by
his old enemy Shadwell. His latter years were passed in comparative
poverty, although the Earl of Dorset and other old friends contributed
by their liberality to lighten his cares. In these circumstances
he turned again to the drama, which, however, was no
longer what it had been as a source of income. To this period
belong <i>Don Sebastian</i>, and his last play, <i>Love Triumphant</i>. A new
mine, however, was beginning to be opened up in the demand for
translations which had arisen. This gave D. a new opportunity,
and he produced, in addition to translations from Juvenal and
Perseus, his famous &quot;Virgil&quot; (1697). About the same time appeared
<i>The Ode for St. Cecilia's Day</i>, and <i>Alexander's Feast</i>, and in
1700, the year of his death, the <i>Fables</i>, largely adaptations from
Chaucer and Boccaccio. In his own line, that of argument, satire,
and declamation, D. is without a rival in our literature: he had
little creative imagination and no pathos. His dramas, which in
bulk are the greatest part of his work, add almost nothing to his
fame; in them he was meeting a public demand, not following the
native bent of his genius. In his satires, and in such poems as
<i>Alexander's Feast</i>, he rises to the highest point of his powers in a
verse swift and heart-stirring. In prose his style is clear, strong,
<a name='Page_124'></a>and nervous. He seems to have been almost insensible to the
beauty of Nature.</p>

In 1655, jointly with Roger Dodsworth, he brought out
the first vol. of <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i> (the second following in
1661, and the third in 1673), containing the charters of the ancient
monasteries. In 1656 he <i>pub.</i> the <i>Antiquities of Warwickshire</i>,
which maintains a high place among county histories, and in 1666
<i>Origines Judiciales</i>. His great work, <i>The Baronage of England</i>,
appeared in 1675-6. Other works were a <i>History of Imbanking and
Drayning</i>, and a <i>History of St. Paul's Cathedral</i>. All D.'s writings

John Leech on the staff of <i>Punch</i>. His three novels, <i>Peter Ibbetson</i>

<a name='DUNBAR_WILLIAM_1465_1530'></a><p><b>DUNBAR, WILLIAM (1465?-1530?).</b>
&mdash;Poet, is believed to
have been <i>b.</i> in Lothian, and <i>ed.</i> at St. Andrews, and in his earlier
days he was a Franciscan friar. Thereafter he appears to have
been employed by James IV. in some Court and political matters.
His chief poems are <i>The Thrissil and the Rois (The Thistle and the
Rose</i>) (1503), <i>The Dance of the Seven Deadly Sins</i>, a powerful satire,
<i>The Golden Targe</i>, an allegory, and <i>The Lament for the Makaris</i>
(poets) (<i>c.</i> 1507). In all these there is a vein of true poetry. In his
allegorical poems he follows Chaucer in his setting, and is thus more
or less imitative and conventional: in his satirical pieces, and in
the <i>Lament</i>, he takes a bolder flight and shows his native power.
His comic poems are somewhat gross. The date and circumstances
of his death are uncertain, some holding that he fell at Flodden,
others that he was alive so late as 1530. Other works are <i>The Merle</i>
and <i>The Nightingale</i>, and the <i>Flyting</i> (scolding) of Dunbar and
Kennedy. Mr. Gosse calls D. &quot;the largest figure in English literature
between Chaucer and Spenser.&quot; He has bright strength,
swiftness, humour, and pathos, and his descriptive touch is vivid
and full of colour.</p><br />

to the Bar in 1807, and became Sheriff of Renfrewshire. He wrote
a <i>History of Fiction</i> (1814), a <i>History of Roman Literature to the

The dates of his birth and death and the place of his birth are
alike doubtful. He may have been at Oxf., is said to have been a
regent or prof. at Paris, and was a Franciscan. He was a man of
extraordinary learning, and received the sobriquet of Doctor
Subtilis. Among his many works on logic and theology are a
philosophic grammar, and a work on metaphysics, <i>De Rerum
Principio</i> (of the beginning of things). His great opponent was
Thomas Aquinas, and schoolmen of the day were divided into
Scotists and Thomists, or realists and nominalists.</p><br />

entitled, <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>. Addison describes him as a
&quot;diverting companion,&quot; and &quot;a cheerful, honest, good-natured

curacies. Then, leaving the Church and settling in London, he
betook himself to his life-work of ed. the English dramatists. His
first work, <i>Specimens of British Poetesses</i>, appeared in 1825; and
thereafter at various intervals ed. of Collins's <i>Poems</i>, and the
dramatic works of <i>Peele, Middleton, Beaumont and Fletcher, Marlowe,

Earl of Leicester, and sent on a mission to Denmark, 1589. He was
in 1596 made Chancellor of the Order of the Garter, and knighted.
In his own day he had a reputation for his elegies among such
judges as Sidney and Puttenham. For a long time there was doubt
as to what poems were to be attributed to him, but about a dozen
pieces have now been apparently identified as his. The best known
is that on contentment beginning, &quot;My mind to me a kingdom is.&quot;</p><br />

In his early years he studied painting, but finding that he
was not likely to attain a satisfactory measure of success, entered
the Church. He has a definite, if a modest, place in literature as
the author of three poems, <i>Grongar Hill</i> (1727), <i>The Ruins of Rome</i>
(1740), and <i>The Fleece</i> (1757). The first of these is the best, and
the best known, and contains much true natural description; but all
have passages of considerable poetical merit, delicacy and precision
of phrase being their most noticeable characteristic. Wordsworth
had a high opinion of D. as a poet, and addressed a sonnet to him.</p><br />

Merton. He took orders, was tutor to Charles II., a member of the
Assembly of Divines at Westminster, 1643, Chaplain and Clerk of
the Closet to Charles when in exile. On the Restoration he was
made Dean of Westminster, in 1662 Bishop of Worcester, and the
next year Bishop of Salisbury. He was learned and eloquent,
witty and agreeable in society, and was opposed to the &quot;Conventicle&quot;
and &quot;Five Mile&quot; Acts, and to all forms of persecution.
He wrote <i>Hortus Mertonensis</i> (the Garden of Merton) in Latin, but
his chief work was <i>Microcosmographie, or a Piece of the World discovered

<i>History of the Revolutions in England</i>, and made numerous compilations
on history, geography, and the classics. His chief work,
however, is his <i>History of England</i> (1707-1720). It covers the
period from the Roman occupation to his own times, and continued
to be the standard work on the subject until it was superseded by
translations of Rapin's French <i>History of England</i>.</p><br />

<a name='EDGEWORTH_MARIA_1767_1849'></a><p><b>EDGEWORTH, MARIA (1767-1849).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, only child
of Richard E., of Edgeworthstown, Co. Longford, was <i>b.</i> near Reading.
Her <i>f.</i>, who was himself a writer on education and mechanics,
bestowed much attention on her education. She showed early
promise of distinction, and assisted her <i>f.</i> in his literary labours,
especially in <i>Practical Education</i> and <i>Essay on Irish Bulls</i> (1802).
She soon discovered that her strength lay in fiction, and from 1800,
when her first novel, <i>Castle Rackrent</i>, appeared, until 1834, when her
last, <i>Helen</i>, was <i>pub.</i>, she continued to produce a series of novels and
tales characterised by ingenuity of invention, humour, and acute
delineation of character. Notwithstanding a tendency to be
didactic, and the presence of a &quot;purpose&quot; in most of her writings,
their genuine talent and interest secured for them a wide popularity.
It was the success of Miss E. in delineating Irish character that suggested
to Sir W. Scott the idea of rendering a similar service to
Scotland. Miss E., who had great practical ability, was able to
render much aid during the Irish famine. In addition to the works
above mentioned, she wrote <i>Moral Tales</i> and <i>Belinda</i> (1801),
<i>Leonora</i> (1806), <i>Tales of Fashionable Life</i> (1809 and 1812), and a
Memoir of her <i>f.</i></p><br />

as tutor at Yale, a position in which he showed exceptional capacity.
In 1726 he went to Northampton, Conn., as minister of a church
there, and remained for 24 years, exercising his ministry with unusual
earnestness and diligence. At the end of that time, however,
he was in 1750 dismissed by his congregation, a disagreement
having arisen on certain questions of discipline. Thereafter he
<a name='Page_128'></a>acted as a missionary to the Indians of Massachusetts. While thus
engaged he composed his famous treatises, <i>On the Freedom of the
Will</i> (1754), and <i>On Original Sin</i> (1758). Previously, in 1746, he
had produced his treatise, <i>On the Religious Affections</i>. In 1757 he
was appointed Pres. of Princeton Coll., New Jersey, but was almost
immediately thereafter stricken with small-pox, of which he <i>d.</i> on
March 22, 1757. E. possessed an intellect of extraordinary strength
and clearness, and was capable of sustaining very lengthened
chains of profound argument. He is one of the ablest defenders of
the Calvinistic system of theology, which he developed to its most
extreme positions. He was a man of fervent piety, and of the
loftiest and most disinterested character.</p><br />

known by his poems on behalf of the poor and oppressed, and
especially for his denunciations of the Corn Laws, which gained for
him the title of the Corn Law Rhymer. Though now little read, he
had considerable poetic gift. His principal poems are <i>Corn Law

reading to him. It is to a question asked by him that we owe the
writing of <i>Paradise Regained</i>. He was a simple, good man, ready to
suffer for his religious opinions, and has left an autobiography of
singular interest alike for the details of Milton's later life, which it
gives, and for the light it casts on the times of the writer. He also

become a Unitarian, and who <i>d.</i> in 1811, leaving a widow with six
children, of whom Ralph, then aged 8, was the second. Mrs. E.
was, however, a woman of energy, and by means of taking boarders
managed to give all her sons a good education. E. entered Harvard
in 1817 and, after passing through the usual course there,
studied for the ministry, to which he was ordained in 1827, and
settled over a congregation in his native city. There he remained
until 1832, when he resigned, ostensibly on a difference of opinion
with his brethren on the permanent nature of the Lord's Supper as
a rite, but really on a radical change of view in regard to religion in
general, expressed in the maxim that &quot;the day of formal religion
is past.&quot; About the same time he lost his young wife, and his
health, which had never been robust, showed signs of failing. In
search of recovery he visited Europe, where he met many eminent
men and formed a life-long friendship with Carlyle. On his return
in 1834 he settled at Concord, and took up lecturing. In 1836 he
<i>pub.</i> <i>Nature</i>, a somewhat transcendental little book which, though
containing much fine thought, did not appeal to a wide circle. <i>The
American Scholar</i> followed in 1837. Two years previously he had
entered into a second marriage. His influence as a thinker rapidly
extended, he was regarded as the leader of the transcendentalists,
and was one of the chief contributors to their organ, <i>The Dial</i>. The
remainder of his life, though happy, busy, and influential, was singularly
uneventful. In 1847 he paid a second visit to England, when
he spent a week with Carlyle, and delivered a course of lectures in
England and Scotland on &quot;Representative Men,&quot; which he subsequently
<i>pub.</i> <i>English Traits</i> appeared in 1856. In 1857 <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i> was started, and to it he became a frequent contributor.
In 1874 he was nominated for the Lord Rectorship of the Univ. of
Glasgow, but was defeated by Disraeli. He, however, regarded his
nomination as the greatest honour of his life. After 1867 he wrote
little. He <i>d.</i> on April 27, 1882. His works were <i>coll.</i> in 11 vols.,
and in addition to those above mentioned include <i>Essays</i> (two
series), <i>Conduct of Life</i>, <i>Society and Solitude</i>, <i>Natural History of Intellect</i>,
and <i>Poems</i>. The intellect of E. was subtle rather than robust,
and suggestive rather than systematic. He wrote down the intuitions
and suggestions of the moment, and was entirely careless as
to whether these harmonised with previous statements. He was an
original and stimulating thinker and writer, and wielded a style of
much beauty and fascination. His religious views approached
more nearly to Pantheism than to any other known system of belief.
He was a man of singular elevation and purity of character.</p><br />

&mdash;Novelist,
was <i>b.</i> near Nuneaton, Warwickshire, <i>dau.</i>
of Robert E., land agent, a man of strong individuality. Her
education was completed at a school in Coventry, and after the
death of her mother in 1836, and the marriage of her elder sister, she
kept house for her <i>f.</i> until his death in 1849. In 1841 they gave up
their house in the country, and went to live in Coventry. Here she
made the acquaintance of Charles Bray, a writer on phrenology,
and his brother-in-law Charles Hennell, a rationalistic writer on the
origin of Christianity, whose influence led her to renounce the
evangelical views in which she had been brought up. In 1846 she
engaged in her first literary work, the completion of a translation
begun by Mrs. Hennell of Strauss's <i>Life of Jesus</i>. On her <i>f.'s</i> death
she went abroad with the Brays, and, on her return in 1850, began
to write for the <i>Westminster Review</i>, of which from 1851-53 she
was assistant-editor. In this capacity she was much thrown into
<a name='Page_132'></a>the society of <a href='#SPENCER_HERBERT_1820_1903'>Herbert Spencer</a> and <a href='#LEWES_GEORGE_HENRY_1817_1878'>George Henry Lewes</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), with
the latter of whom she in 1854 entered into an irregular connection
which lasted until his death. In the same year she translated
Feuerbach's <i>Essence of Christianity</i>, the only one of her writings to
which she attached her real name. It was not until she was nearly
40 that she appears to have discovered the true nature of her
genius; for it was not until 1857 that <i>The Sad Fortunes of the Rev.
Amos Barton</i> appeared in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, and announced
that a new writer of singular power had arisen. It was followed by
<i>Mr. Gilfil's Love Story</i> and <i>Janet's Repentance</i>, all three being reprinted
as <i>Scenes from Clerical Life</i> (1857); <i>Adam Bede</i> was <i>pub.</i> in
1859, <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, in its earlier chapters largely autobiographical,
in 1860, <i>Silas Marner</i>, perhaps the most artistically constructed
of her books, in 1861. In 1860 and 1861 she visited Florence
with the view of preparing herself for her next work, <i>Romola</i>, a tale
of the times of Savonarola, which appeared in 1863 in the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i>. <i>Felix Holt the Radical</i> followed in 1866. Miss E. now
for a time abandoned novel-writing and took to poetry, and between
1868 and 1871 produced <i>The Spanish Gipsy</i>, <i>Agatha</i>, <i>The Legend of
Jubal</i>, and <i>Armgart</i>. These poems, though containing much fine
work, did not add to her reputation, and in fact in writing them she
had departed from her true vocation. Accordingly, she returned
to fiction, and in <i>Middlemarch</i>, which appeared in parts in 1871-72,
she was by many considered to have produced her greatest work.
<i>Daniel Deronda</i>, which came out in 1874-76, was greatly inferior,
and it was her last novel. In 1878 she <i>pub.</i> <i>The Impressions
of Theophrastus Such</i>, a collection of miscellaneous essays. In
the same year Mr. Lewes <i>d.</i>, an event which plunged her into
melancholy, which was, however, alleviated by the kindness of Mr.
John Cross, who had been the intimate friend of both L. and herself,
and whom she <i>m.</i> in March, 1880. The union was a short one,
being terminated by her death on December 22 in the same year.</p>

<p>George Eliot will probably always retain a high place among
writers of fiction. Her great power lies in the minute painting of
character, chiefly among the lower middle classes, shopkeepers,
tradesmen, and country folk of the Midlands, into whose thoughts
and feelings she had an insight almost like divination, and of whose
modes of expression she was complete mistress. Her general view
of life is pessimistic, relieved by a power of seizing the humorous
elements in human stupidity and ill-doing. There is also, however,
much seriousness in her treatment of the phases of life upon
which she touches, and few writers have brought out with greater
power the hardening and degrading effects of continuance in evil
courses, or the inevitable and irretrievable consequences of a wrong
act. Her descriptions of rural scenes have a singular charm.</p>

&mdash;Diarist, and miscellaneous
writer, was of an old Surrey family, and was <i>ed.</i> at a school at Lewes
and at Oxf. He travelled much on the Continent, seeing all that
was best worth seeing in the way of galleries and collections, both
public and private, of which he has given an interesting account in
<a name='Page_133'></a>his <i>Diary</i>. He was all his life a staunch Royalist, and joined the
King as a volunteer in 1642, but soon after repaired again to the
Continent. After 1652 he was at home, settled at Sayes Court, near
Deptford, where his gardens were famous. After the Restoration
he was employed in various matters by the Government, but his
lofty and pure character was constantly offended by the manners
of the Court. In addition to his <i>Diary</i>, kept up from 1624-1706,
and which is full of interesting details of public and private events,
he wrote upon such subjects as plantations, <i>Sylva</i> (1664), gardening,
<i>Elysium Britannicum</i> (<i>unpub.</i>), architecture, prevention of smoke
in London, engraving, <i>Sculptura</i> (1662), and he was one of the
founders of the Royal Society, of which he was for a time sec. The
dignity and purity of E'.s character stand forth in strong relief
against the laxity of his times.</p><br />

few translations which in themselves are literature. It was highly
praised by Dryden and Waller. The first ed. appeared in 1600, and

He had an unusual power of making difficult subjects clearly understood.
Among his writings are <i>History of the Progress of Electro-Magnetism</i>

spite of which he continued to prosecute his studies, especially in
economics, and in 1863 <i>pub.</i> his <i>Manual of Political Economy</i>, becoming
in the same year Prof. of Political Economy in Camb.
Having strong political views he desired to enter upon a political

premature death, but not before he had made himself a recognised
authority on economics, his works on which include <i>The Economic

As a young man he was chaplain to the 42nd Regiment, and was
present at the Battle of Fontenoy. In 1757 he was made Keeper of
the Advocates' Library. As a Prof. of Philosophy he was highly
successful, his class being attended by many distinguished men no

<a name='FIELDING_HENRY_1707_1754'></a><p><b>FIELDING, HENRY (1707-1754).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, was <i>b.</i> at
Sharpham Park, near Glastonbury. His father was General
Edmund F., descended from the Earls of Denbigh and Desmond,
and his mother was the <i>dau.</i> of Sir Henry Gould of Sharpham Park.
His childhood was spent at East Stour, Dorset, and his education
was received at first from a tutor, after which he was sent to
Eton. Following a love affair with a young heiress at Lyme Regis
he was sent to Leyden to study law, where he remained until his <i>f.</i>,
who had entered into a second marriage, and who was an extravagant
man, ceased to send his allowance. Thrown upon his own
resources, he came to London and began to write light comedies
and farces, of which during the next few years he threw off nearly a
score. The drama, however, was not his true vein, and none of his
pieces in this kind have survived, unless <i>Tom Thumb</i>, a burlesque
upon his contemporary playwrights, be excepted. About 1735 he
<i>m.</i> Miss Charlotte Cradock, a beautiful and amiable girl to whom,
though he gave her sufficient cause for forbearance, he was devotedly
attached. She is the prototype of his &quot;Amelia&quot; and &quot;Sophia.&quot;
She brought him &pound;1500, and the young couple retired to East Stour,
where he had a small house inherited from his mother. The little
fortune was, however, soon dissipated; and in a year he was back
in London, where he formed a company of comedians, and managed
a small theatre in the Haymarket. Here he produced successfully
<i>Pasquin, a Dramatic Satire on the Times</i>, and <i>The Historical Register
for 1736</i>, in which Walpole was satirised. This enterprise was
<a name='Page_138'></a>brought to an end by the passing of the Licensing Act, 1737, making
the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Lord Chamberlain necessary to the production
of any play. F. thereupon read law at the Middle Temple, was
called to the Bar in 1740, and went the Western Circuit. The
same year saw the publication of Richardson's <i>Pamela</i>, which inspired
F. with the idea of a parody, thus giving rise to his first novel,
<i>Joseph Andrews</i>. As, however, the characters, especially Parson
Adams, developed in his hands, the original idea was laid aside, and
the work assumed the form of a regular novel. It was <i>pub.</i> in 1742,
and though sharing largely in the same qualities as its great successor,
<i>Tom Jones</i>, its reception, though encouraging, was not phenomenally
cordial. Immediately after this a heavy blow fell on F. in the death
of his wife. The next few years were occupied with writing his <i>Miscellanies</i>,
which contained, along with some essays and poems, two
important works, <i>A Journey from this World to the Next</i>, and <i>The
History of Jonathan Wild the Great</i>, a grave satire; and he also conducted
two papers in support of the Government, <i>The True Patriot</i>
and <i>The Jacobite Journal</i>, in consideration of which he was appointed
Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and Westminster, and had a
pension conferred upon him. In 1746 he set convention at defiance
by marrying Mary MacDaniel, who had been his first wife's maid,
and the nurse of his children, and who proved a faithful and affectionate
companion. F. showed himself an upright, diligent, and
efficient magistrate, and his <i>Inquiry into the Increase of Robbers</i>
(1751), with suggested remedies, led to beneficial results. By this
time, however, the publication of his great masterpiece, <i>The History
of Tom Jones, a Foundling</i> (1749), had given him a place among the
immortals. All critics are agreed that this book contains passages
offensive to delicacy, and some say to morality. This is often
excused on the plea of the coarser manners of the age; but a much
stronger defence is advanced on the ground that, while other
novelists of the time made immorality an incentive to merriment,
F.'s treatment of such subjects, as Lowell has said, &quot;shocks rather
than corrupts,&quot; and that in his pages evil is evil. On the other hand,
there is universal agreement as to the permanent interest of the
types of character presented, the profound knowledge of life and
insight into human nature, the genial humour, the wide humanity,
the wisdom, and the noble and masculine English of the book. His
only other novel, <i>Amelia</i>, which some, but these a small minority,
have regarded as his best, was <i>pub.</i> in 1751. His health was now
thoroughly broken, and in 1753, as a forlorn hope, he went in
search of restoration to Lisbon, where he <i>d.</i> on October 8, and was
buried in the English cemetery. His last work was a <i>Journal</i> of his
voyage. Though with many weaknesses and serious faults, F. was
fundamentally a man of honest and masculine character, and
though improvident and reckless in his habits, especially in earlier
life, he was affectionate in his domestic relations, and faithful and
efficient in the performance of such public duties as he was called to
discharge. Thackeray thus describes his appearance, &quot;His figure
was tall and stalwart, his face handsome, manly, and noble-looking;
to the last days of his life he retained a grandeur of air and, though
worn down by disease, his aspect and presence imposed respect upon
people round about him.&quot;</p><a name='Page_139'></a>

&mdash;Novelist, was the sister
of the above, who had a high opinion of her talents. She wrote
several novels, including <i>David Simple</i> (1744), <i>The Governess</i>,
and <i>The Countess</i> of <i>Dellwyn</i>. She also translated Xenophon's
<i>Memorabilia</i> and <i>Apologia</i> (1762).</p><br />

<a name='FILMER_SIR_ROBERT_d_1653'></a><p><b>FILMER, SIR ROBERT (<i>d.</i> 1653?).</b>
&mdash;Political writer,
<i>s.</i> of Sir Edward F., of East Sutton, Kent, was <i>ed.</i> at Camb. He
was an enthusiastic Royalist, was knighted by Charles I. and, in
1671, was imprisoned in Leeds Castle, Kent. He is notable as the
defender, in its most extreme form, of the doctrine of the divine
right of kings, which he expounded in a succession of works, of
which the latest and best known, <i>Patriarcha</i>, appeared in 1679.
His theory is founded on the idea that the government of a family
by the father is the original and method of all government. His
doctrines were afterwards attacked by Locke in his <i>Treatise on
Government</i>. He was opposed to the persecution of old women for
supposed witchcraft.</p><br />

&mdash;Historian, of Scottish
descent, was <i>b.</i> at Faversham, Kent, where his <i>f.</i>, an officer in the
army, was inspector of government powder mills. Intended for
the law, he was <i>ed.</i> at Glasgow, G&ouml;ttingen, and Edin., but becoming
an enthusiast in the cause of Greece, he joined Byron in the war
of independence, and thereafter bought a property near Athens,
where he settled and busied himself with schemes for the improvement
of the country, which had little success. His <i>History of
Greece</i>, produced in sections between 1843 and 1861, did not at first
receive the recognition which its merits deserved, but it has since
been given by students in all countries, and specially in Germany, a
place among works of permanent value, alike for its literary style
and the depth and insight of its historical views. It was re-issued
in 1877 as <i>A History of Greece from the Roman Conquest to the Present
Time</i> (146 B.C. <i>to</i> 1864).</p><br />

<a name='FISHER_JOHN_c_1469_1535'></a><p><b>FISHER, JOHN (<i>c.</i> 1469-1535).</b>
&mdash;Controversialist and
scholar, <i>b.</i> at Beverley, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., entered the Church, and
became in 1504 Bishop of Rochester. He wrote in Latin against
the doctrines of the Reformation, but was a supporter of the New
Learning, and endeavoured to get Erasmus to teach Greek at Camb.
Through his influence the Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity
were founded at both the Univ. by Margaret Countess of Richmond,
<a name='Page_140'></a>and in 1502 he became first prof. at Camb., where he was also
(1505-8) Head of Queen's Coll. He was also instrumental in founding
Christ's and St. John's Coll. For opposing the divorce proceedings
of Henry VIII. he was burned. Made a cardinal in 1535, he
was beatified in 1886.</p><br />

<a name='FISKE_JOHN_1842_1901'></a><p><b>FISKE, JOHN (1842-1901).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous writer, was <i>b.</i>
at Hartford, Connecticut. The family name was Green; but this
he dropped, and adopted that of his mother's family. After being
at Harvard he studied for, and was admitted to, the Bar, but did not
practise. He wrote on a variety of subjects, including mythology,
history, and evolution. Among his books on these subjects are,
<i>Myths and Mythmakers</i> (1872), <i>Cosmic Philosophy</i>, <i>Darwinism</i>, <i>The
Idea of God</i>, <i>Origin of Evil</i>. He was also the author of many works
on America. These include <i>Old Virginia</i>, <i>New France and New
England</i>, <i>The American Revolution</i>, and <i>Discovery of America</i> (1892).</p><br />

<a name='FITZGERALD_EDWARD_1809_1883'></a><p><b>FITZGERALD, EDWARD (1809-1883).</b>
&mdash;Translator and
letter-writer, was <i>b.</i> near Woodbridge, Suffolk, <i>s.</i> of John Purcell,
who took his wife's surname on the death of her <i>f.</i>. in 1818. He was
<i>ed.</i> at Bury St. Edmunds and Camb. Thereafter he lived in retirement
and study with his parents until 1838, when he took a neighbouring
cottage. In 1856 he <i>m.</i> a <i>dau.</i> of Bernard Barton, the poet,
from whom, however, he soon separated. Afterwards he lived at
various places in the East of England, continuing his studies, with
yachting for his chief recreation. By this time, however, he had
become an author, having written a life of his father-in-law prefixed
to his <i>coll.</i> poems (1849), <i>Euphranor</i>, a dialogue on youth (1851), and
<i>Polonius, a Collection of Wise Saws and Modern Instances</i> (1852).
Becoming interested in Spanish literature, he <i>pub.</i> translations of
<i>Six Dramas of Calderon</i>. Thereafter turning his attention to
Persian, he produced (1859), anonymously, his famous translation
of the <i>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>. He also <i>pub.</i> translations of
the <i>Agamemnon</i> of &AElig;schylus, and the <i>&OElig;dipus Tyrannus</i> and
<i>&OElig;dipus Coloneus</i> of Sophocles. In his translations F. aimed not so
much at a mere literal reproduction of the sense of the original, as
at reproducing its effect on the reader, and in this he was extraordinarily
successful. In the department of letter-writing also he
attained an excellence perhaps unequalled in his day.</p><br />

&mdash;Divine, <i>b.</i> at Bromsgrove,
studied at Oxf., was a Presbyterian, and was settled at Dartmouth,
but ejected from his living in 1662, continuing, however, to preach
there secretly. He was a voluminous and popular author. Among
his works are <i>Husbandry Spiritualised</i> and <i>Navigation Spiritualised</i>,
titles which suggest some of his characteristics as an expositor.</p><br />

His name has been preserved in Dryden's satire, <i>MacFlecknoe</i>, as<a name='Page_141'></a>
&quot;throughout the realms of nonsense absolute;&quot; but according to

<a name='FLETCHER_ANDREW_1655_1716'></a><p><b>FLETCHER, ANDREW (1655-1716).</b>
&mdash;Scottish statesman
and political writer, <i>s.</i> of Sir Robert F. of Saltoun, East Lothian, to
which estate he succeeded at an early age. He was <i>ed.</i> under the
care of Bishop Burnet, who was then minister of Saltoun. Being
firmly opposed to the arbitrary measures of the Duke of York, afterwards
James II., he went to Holland, where he joined Monmouth,
whom he accompanied on his ill-starred expedition. Happening
to kill, in a quarrel, one Dare, another of the Duke's followers, he
fled to the Continent, travelled in Spain and Hungary, and fought
against the Turks. After the Revolution he returned to Scotland,
and took an active part in political affairs. He opposed the Union,
fearing the loss of Scottish independence, and advocated federation
rather than incorporation. He introduced various improvements
in agriculture. His principal writings are <i>Discourse of Government</i>
(1698), <i>Two Discourses concerning the Affairs of Scotland</i> (1698),
<i>Conversation concerning a right Regulation of Government for the
Common Good of Mankind</i> (1703), in which occurs his well-known
saying, &quot;Give me the making of the songs of a nation, and I care
not who makes its laws.&quot;</p><br />

&mdash;Poets,
were the sons of Giles F., himself a minor poet, and Envoy
to Russia. Phineas, the elder, was <i>ed.</i> at Eton and Camb., and
entered the Church, becoming Rector of Hilgay, Norfolk. He
wrote <i>The Purple Island</i> (1633), a poem in 10 books, giving an
elaborate allegorical description of the body and mind of man,
which, though tedious and fanciful, contains some fine passages, recalling
the harmonious sweetness of Spenser, whose disciple the poet
was. He was also the author of <i>Piscatory Dialogues</i>. GILES, the
younger, was also <i>ed.</i> at Camb., and, like his brother, became a
country parson, being Rector of Alderton. His poem, <i>Christ's Victory
and Triumph</i> (1610), which, though it contains passages rising to
sublimity, is now almost unknown except to students of English
literature, is said to have influenced Milton.</p>

<p>Both brothers, but especially Giles, had a genuine poetic gift, but
alike in the allegorical treatment of their subjects and the metre
they adopted, they followed a style which was passing away, and
thus missed popularity. They were cousins of John F., the
dramatist.</p><br />

<a name='FLORENCE_of_WORCESTER_d_1118'></a><p><b>FLORENCE of WORCESTER (<i>d.</i> 1118).</b>

a monk of Worcester. His work is founded upon that of Marianus,
an Irish chronicler, supplemented by additions taken from the
<i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, Bede's <i>Lives of the Saints</i>, and Asser's <i>Life
of Alfred</i>. After his death it was brought down to 1295.</p><br />

&mdash;Translator, <i>s.</i> of an Italian
preacher, exiled for his Protestantism, but who appears to have lost
credit owing to misconduct, <i>b.</i> in London, was, about 1576, a private
tutor of languages at Oxf. In 1581 he was admitted a member of<a name='Page_142'></a>
Magdalen Coll., and teacher of French and Italian. Patronised by
various noblemen, he became in 1603 reader in Italian to Anne of
Denmark, Queen of James I. He <i>pub.</i> <i>First Fruites</i> (1578). <i>Second
Fruites</i> (1591), consisting of Italian and English Dialogues, and his
great Italian dictionary entitled <i>A World of Wonder</i>, in 1598. His
chief contribution to pure literature is his famous translation of <i>The
Essays of Montaigne</i>, in stately if somewhat stiff Elizabethan English.</p><br />

in Bankruptcy. He was bred to the law, but deserted it for
journalism, in which he took a high place. He wrote much for <i>The
Times</i>, and <i>Westminster Review</i>, and subsequently became ed. and
proprietor of the <i>Examiner</i>. His best articles were republished as
<i>England under Seven Administrations</i> (1837). He also wrote <i>How
we are Governed</i>. In 1847 he was appointed Statistical Sec. to the
Board of Trade.</p><br />

<a name='FOOTE_SAMUEL_1720_1777'></a><p><b>FOOTE, SAMUEL (1720-1777).</b>
&mdash;Actor and dramatist, <i>b.</i> at
Truro of a good family, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., succeeded by his extravagance
and folly in running through two fortunes. To repair his
finances he turned to the stage, and began with tragedy, in which
he failed. He then took to comedy, and the mimetic representation
of living characters, for which his extraordinary comic powers
highly qualified him. He also became a prolific author of dramatic
pieces. He wrote 20 plays, and claimed to have added 16 original
characters to the stage. Several of his pieces, owing to the offence
they gave to persons of importance, were suppressed, but were
usually revived in a slightly modified form. His conversation was
agreeable and entertaining in the highest degree. Among his best
works are <i>An Auction of Pictures</i>, <i>The Liar</i>, and <i>The Mayor of
Garratt</i> (1763), <i>The Lame Lover</i> (1770), <i>The Knights</i> (1749), <i>Author</i>
(suppressed) 1757, <i>Devil upon Two Sticks</i> (1768), <i>The Nabob</i> (1779),

studied law, and was called to the Bar, but devoted himself to
science, in which he gained a great reputation both as a discoverer
and teacher. He was Prof. of Natural Philosophy at Edin., 1833-1859,
when he succeeded Sir D. Brewster, as Principal of the United
Coll. at St. Andrews. He was one of the founders of the British
Association in 1831. His scientific investigations and discoveries
embraced the subjects of heat, light, polarisation, and specially
glaciers. In connection with the last of these he wrote <i>Travels
through the Alps</i> (1843), <i>Norway and its Glaciers</i> (1853), <i>Tour of Mont
Blanc and Monte Rosa</i> (1855), and <i>Papers on the Theory of Glaciers</i>.</p><br />

&mdash;Dramatist, <i>b.</i> probably at
Ilsington, Devonshire, was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1602,
and appears to have practised as a lawyer. His chief plays are <i>The
Lover's Melancholy</i> (1629), <i>'Tis Pity</i>, <i>The Broken Heart</i>, and <i>Love's
Sacrifice</i> (1633), <i>Perkin Warbeck</i> (1634), <i>The Lady's Trial</i> (1639),
and <i>Fancies Chaste and Noble</i> (1638). He also collaborated with<a name='Page_143'></a>
Dekker and Rowley in <i>The Witch of Edmonton</i> (1624). F. has a
high position as a dramatist, though rather for general intellectual
power and austere beauty of thought than for strictly dramatic
qualities. C. Lamb says, &quot;F. was of the first order of poets.&quot; He
had little humour; his plays, though the subjects are painful, and
sometimes horrible, are full of pensive tenderness expressed in
gently flowing verse. The date of his death is uncertain.</p><br />

of novels, which had considerable success, including <i>Peter Sterling</i>
(1894), <i>Story of an Untold Love</i>, <i>Janice Meredith</i>, <i>Wanted a Matchmaker</i>,

Spain, becoming intimately acquainted with the country and people.
He wrote a <i>Handbook for Travellers in Spain</i> (1845), which is much
more than a mere guide-book, and <i>Gatherings from Spain</i> (1846).
An accomplished artist and art critic, he was the first to make the
great Spanish painter, Velasquez, generally known in England.</p><br />

<a name='FORDUN_JOHN_d_1384'></a><p><b>FORDUN, JOHN (<i>d.</i> 1384?).</b>
&mdash;Chronicler, said to have

<i>Scotichronicon</i>, for which he prepared himself, it is said, by travelling
on foot through Britain and Ireland in search of materials. He also
compiled <i>Gesta Annalia</i>, a continuation. He brought the history
down to 1153, leaving, however, material to the time of his own
death, which was subsequently worked up by <a href='#BOWER_or_BOWMAKER_WALTER_d_1449'>Walter Bower</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p><br />

&mdash;Historian and biographer,
<i>b.</i> at Newcastle, <i>ed.</i> at the Grammar School there, and at Univ. Coll.,
London, became a barrister of the Inner Temple, but soon relinquished
law for literature. In 1834 he accepted the post of assistant
ed. of the <i>Examiner</i>, and was ed. 1847-55. In this position F.
exercised a marked influence on public opinion. He also ed. the
<i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i> 1842-3, the <i>Daily News</i> in 1846, and was
Sec. to the Lunacy Commission and a Commissioner 1861-72.
His historical writings were chiefly biographies, among which are
<i>Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England</i> (1836-9), <i>Life of Goldsmith</i>
(1854), <i>Biographical and Historical Essays</i> (1859), <i>Sir John
Eliot</i> (1864), <i>Lives of Walter S. Landor</i> (1868), and <i>Charles Dickens</i>
(1871-4). He also left the first vol. of a Life of Swift. F., who
was a man of great decision and force of character, concealed an
unusually tender heart under a somewhat overbearing manner.</p><br />

<a name='FORTESCUE_SIR_JOHN_1394_1476'></a><p><b>FORTESCUE, SIR JOHN (1394?-1476?).</b>
&mdash;Political writer,
was descended from a Devonshire family. He was an eminent
lawyer, and held the office of Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench
(1442). During the Wars of the Roses he was a staunch Lancastrian.
On the triumph of Edward IV. at Towton he was attainted,
and followed the fortunes of the fallen Lancastrians, accompanying
Queen Margaret to Scotland and Flanders. He fought at Tewkesbury,
was captured, but pardoned on condition of writing in support
<a name='Page_144'></a>of the Yorkish claims, which he did, considering that his own party
appeared to be hopelessly ruined. He is said to have been at one
time Lord Chancellor; but it is probable that this was only a titular
appointment given him by the exiled family. His works are
various defences of the Lancastrian title to the crown, and two
treatises, <i>De Laudibus Legum Angli&aelig;</i> (1537) (in praise of the laws
of England), and <i>On the Governance of the Kingdom of England</i>, not
printed till 1714, the former for the instruction of Edward, Prince
of Wales.</p><br />

&mdash;Essayist, was <i>b.</i> at Halifax,
and <i>ed.</i> at Bristol for the Baptist ministry. Though a man of powerful
and original mind he did not prove popular as a preacher, and
devoted himself mainly to literature, his chief contribution to
which is his four Essays (1) <i>On a Man's Writing Memoirs of Himself</i>,
(2) <i>On Decision of Character</i>, (3) <i>On the Epithet &quot;Romantic</i>,&quot; (4) <i>On
Evangelical Religion, etc.</i>, all of which attracted much attention
among the more thoughtful part of the community, and still hold
their place. These Essays were <i>pub.</i> in 1805, and in 1819. F.
added another on the <i>Evils of Popular Ignorance</i>, in which he
advocated a national system of education.</p><br />

extraordinary popularity, among which may be mentioned <i>The Old
Folks at Home</i>, <i>Nelly Bly</i>, <i>Old Dog Tray</i>, <i>Camp Town Races</i>, <i>Massa's
in de cold, cold Ground</i>, and <i>Come where my Love lies Dreaming</i>. He

&mdash;Statesman and historian,
<i>s.</i> of Henry F., 1st Lord Holland, was one of the greatest
orators who have ever sat in the House of Commons. His only
serious literary work was a fragment of a proposed <i>History of the
Reign of James the Second</i>. An introductory chapter sketching the
development of the constitution from the time of Henry VII., and
a few chapters conducting the history up to the execution of Monmouth
are all which he completed.</p><br />

<a name='FOX_GEORGE_1624_1691'></a><p><b>FOX, GEORGE (1624-1691).</b>
&mdash;Religious enthusiast, and
founder of the Society of Friends, <i>b.</i> at Drayton, Leicestershire, was
in youth the subject of peculiar religious impressions and trances,
and adopted a wandering life. The protests which he conceived
himself bound to make against the prevailing beliefs and manners,
and which sometimes took the form of interrupting Divine service,
and the use of uncomplimentary forms of address to the clergy,
involved him in frequent trouble. The clergy, the magistrates, and
the mob alike treated him with harshness amounting to persecution.
None of these things, however, moved him, and friends, many of
them influential, among them Oliver Cromwell, extended favour
towards him. From 1659 onwards he made various missionary
journeys in Scotland, Ireland, America, and Holland. Later he
was repeatedly imprisoned, again visited the Continent, and <i>d.</i>
in 1691. F.'s literary works are his <i>Journal</i>, <i>Epistles</i>, and <i>Doctrinal
Pieces</i>. He was not a man of strong intellect, and the defence of his
<a name='Page_145'></a>doctrines was undertaken by the far more competent hand of his
follower, <a href='#BARCLAY_ROBERT_1648_1690'>Barclay</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). The <i>Journal</i>, however, is full of interest as
a sincere transcript of the singular experiences, religious and others,
of a spiritual enthusiast and mystic.</p>

<a name='FOXE_JOHN_1516_1587'></a><p><b>FOXE, JOHN (1516-1587).</b>
&mdash;Martyrologist, was <i>b.</i> at
Boston, Lincolnshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., where he became a Fellow of
Magdalen Coll. While there he gave himself to the study of the
theological questions then in debate, and ended by becoming a
Protestant, in consequence of which he in 1545 left his coll. He
then became tutor in the family of Sir T. Lucy of Charlecote, and
afterwards to the children of the recently executed Earl of Surrey.
During the reign of Mary he retired to the Continent, and <i>pub.</i>, at
Strasburg, his <i>Commentarii</i> (the first draft of the <i>Acts and Monuments</i>).
Removing to Basel he was employed as a reader for the
press by the famous printer Oporinus, who <i>pub.</i> some of his writings.
On the accession of Elizabeth, F. returned to England, was received
with kindness by the Duke of Norfolk, one of his former pupils, and
soon afterwards (1563) <i>pub.</i> the work on which his fame rests, the
English version of the <i>Acts and Monuments</i>, better known as <i>The
Book Martyrs</i>. Received with great favour by the Protestants,
it was, and has always been, charged by the Roman Catholics with
gross and wilful perversion of facts. The truth of the matter
appears to be that while Foxe was not, as in the circumstances he
could hardly have been, free from party spirit or from some degree
of error as to facts, he did not intentionally try to mislead; and
comparison of his citations from authorities with the originals has
shown him to have been careful and accurate in that matter. F.,
who had been ordained a priest in 1560, became Canon of Salisbury
in 1563. He wrote sundry other theological works, and <i>d.</i> in 1587.
There is a memoir of him attributed to his <i>s.</i>, but of doubtful

<a name='FRANCIS_SIR_PHILIP_1740_1818'></a><p><b>FRANCIS, SIR PHILIP (1740-1818).</b>
&mdash;Reputed author of
<i>The Letters of Junius</i>, <i>s.</i> of the Rev. Philip F., a scholar of some note,
was <i>b.</i> in Dublin. On the recommendation of Lord Holland he
received an appointment in the office of the Sec. of State, and was
thereafter private sec. to Lord Kinnoull in Portugal, and to Pitt
in 1761-2. He was then transferred to the War Office, where he
remained from 1762-72, during which period he contributed to the
press under various pseudonyms. His next appointment was that
of a member of Council of Bengal, which he held from 1773-80.
While in India he was in continual conflict with the Governor-General,
Warren Hastings, by whom he was wounded in a duel in
1779. He returned to England in 1780 with a large fortune, and
entered Parliament as a Whig. In 1787 he was associated with
Burke in the impeachment of Hastings, against whom he showed
extraordinary vindictiveness. Later he was a sympathiser with the
French Revolution, and a member of the association of the Friends
of the People. He retired from public life in 1807, and <i>d.</i> in 1818.
He was the author of about 20 political pamphlets, but the great
interest attaching to him is his reputed authorship of the <i>Letters of<a name='Page_146'></a>
Junius</i>. These letters which, partly on account of the boldness and
implacability of their attacks and the brilliance of their literary
style, and partly because of the mystery in which their author
wrapped himself, created an extraordinary impression, and have
ever since retained their place as masterpieces of condensed sarcasm.
They appeared in <i>The Public Advertiser</i>, a paper <i>pub.</i> by Woodfall,
the first on January 21, 1769, and the last on the corresponding day
of 1772, and were chiefly directed against the Dukes of Grafton and
Bedford, and Lord Mansfield; but even the king himself did not
escape. Not only were the public actions of those attacked held up
to execration, but every circumstance in their private lives which
could excite odium was dragged into the light. Their authorship
was attributed to many distinguished men, <i>e.g.</i> Burke, Lord Shelburne,
J. Wilkes, Horne Tooke, and Barr&eacute;, and recently to Gibbon;
but the evidence appears to point strongly to F., and, in the opinion
of Macaulay, would &quot;support a verdict in a civil, nay, in a criminal
trial.&quot; It rests upon such circumstances as the similarity of the MS.
to what is known to be the disguised writing of F., the acquaintance
of the writer with the working of the Sec. of State's Office and the
War Office, his denunciation of the promotion of a Mr. Chamier in the
War Office, which was a well-known grievance of F., his acquaintance
with Pitt, and the existence of a strong tie to Lord Holland,
the silence of Junius when F. was absent, and resemblances in the
style and the moral character of the writer to those of F.</p><br />

<a name='FRANKLIN_BENJAMIN_1706_1790'></a><p><b>FRANKLIN, BENJAMIN (1706-1790).</b>
&mdash;American statesman,
philosopher, and writer, was one of a numerous family. His <i>f.</i>
was a soap-boiler at Boston, where F. was <i>b.</i> He was apprenticed
at the age of 13 to his brother, a printer, who treated him harshly.
After various changes, during which he lived in New York, London,
and Philadelphia, he at last succeeded in founding a successful
business as a printer. He also started a newspaper, <i>The Gazette</i>,
which was highly popular, <i>Poor Richard's Almanac</i>, and the <i>Busybody
Papers</i>, in imitation of the <i>Spectator</i>. After holding various
minor appointments, he was made deputy Postmaster-General for
the American Colonies. In 1757 he went to London on some public
business in which he was so successful that various colonies appointed
him their English agent. In the midst of his varied avocations he
found time for scientific investigation, especially with regard to electricity.
For these he became known over the civilised world, and
was loaded with honours. In 1762 he returned to America, and took
a prominent part in the controversies which led to the Revolutionary
War and the independence of the Colonies. In 1776 he was U.S.
Minister to France, and in 1782 was a signatory of the treaty which
confirmed the independence of the States. He returned home in
1785, and, after holding various political offices, retired in 1788, and
<i>d.</i> in 1790. His autobiography is his chief contribution to literature,
and is of the highest interest.</p>

&mdash;Historian,
<i>s.</i> of John F., was <i>b.</i> at Harborne, Staffordshire. He lost both his
parents in childhood, and was brought up by his paternal grandmother.<a name='Page_147'></a>
He was <i>ed.</i> at private schools, and as a private pupil of
the Rev. R. Gutch, whose <i>dau.</i> he afterwards <i>m.</i> In 1841 he was
elected to a scholarship at Oxf. He had inherited an income sufficient
to make him independent of a profession, and a prepossession
in favour of the celibacy of the clergy disinclined him to enter the
Church, of which he had at one time thought. He settled ultimately
at Somerleaze, near Wells, where he occupied himself in study,
writing for periodicals, and with the duties of a magistrate. He
was a strong Liberal, and on one occasion stood unsuccessfully as a
candidate for Parliament. He was also twice unsuccessful as an
applicant for professional chairs, but ultimately, in 1884, succeeded
Stubbs as Prof. of Modern History at Oxf. He had always been an
enthusiastic traveller, and it was when on a tour in Spain that he
took ill and <i>d.</i> on May 16, 1892. F. was a voluminous author, and
a keen controversialist. His first book was a <i>History of Architecture</i>
(1849), and among the very numerous publications which he issued
the most important were <i>History of Federal Government</i> (1863), <i>The
History of the Norman Conquest</i> (6 vols., 1867-79), <i>The Historical
Geography of Europe</i> (1881-2), <i>The Reign of William
Rufus</i> (1882),
and an unfinished <i>History of Sicily</i>. Besides these he wrote innumerable
articles in periodicals, many of which were separately <i>pub.</i>
and contain much of his best work. He was laborious and honest,
but the controversial cast of his mind sometimes coloured his work.
His short books, such as his <i>William I.</i>, and his <i>General Sketch of
European History</i>, are marvels of condensation, and show him at his
best. His knowledge of history was singularly wide, and he sometimes
showed a great power of vivid presentation.</p><br />

produced two vols. of verse (1786-8), the most considerable contribution
to poetry made up to that date in America. He fought in
the Revolutionary War, was taken prisoner, and confined in a
British prison-ship, the arrangements of which he bitterly satirised
in <i>The British Prison Ship</i> (1781). He also wrote vigorous prose, of
which <i>Advice to Authors</i> is an example. Amid much commonplace
and doggerel, F. produced a small amount of genuine poetry in his
short pieces, such as <i>The Indian Burying Ground</i>, and <i>The Wild
Honeysuckle</i>.</p><br />

masterly translations from <i>Aristophanes</i>; but his chief original
contribution to literature was a burlesque poem on <i>Arthur and the

<a name='FROUDE_JAMES_ANTHONY_1818_1894'></a><p><b>FROUDE, JAMES ANTHONY (1818-1894).</b>
&mdash;Historian and
essayist, 3rd <i>s.</i> of the Archdeacon of Totnes, Devonshire, near
<a name='Page_148'></a>which he was <i>b.</i>, and brother of Richard Hurrell. F., one of the
leaders of the Tractarian party, was <i>ed.</i> at Westminster School and
Oxf., where for a short time he came under the influence of Newman,
and contributed to his <i>Lives of the English Saints</i>, and in 1844
he took Deacon's orders. The connection with Newman was, however,
short-lived; and the publication in 1848 of <i>The Nemesis of
Faith</i> showed that in the severe mental and spiritual conflict through
which he had passed, the writer had not only escaped from all
Tractarian influences, but was in revolt against many of the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity. One result of the book was his
resignation of his Fellowship at Oxf.: another was his loss of an
appointment as Head Master of the Grammar School of Hobart
Town, Tasmania. In the same year began his friendship with
Carlyle, and about the same time he became a contributor to the
<i>Westminster Review</i> and to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, of which he was ed.
from 1860-74. These papers were afterwards <i>coll.</i> and <i>pub.</i> in the 4
vols. of <i>Short Studies on Great Subjects</i>. In 1856 he <i>pub.</i> the first 2
vols. of the great work of his life, <i>The History of England from the
Fall of Cardinal Wolsey to the Spanish Armada</i>, which extended to
12 vols., the last of which appeared in 1870. As literature this work
has a place among the greatest productions of the century; but in
its treatment it is much more dramatic, ethical, and polemical than
historical in the strict sense; and indeed the inaccuracy in matters
of fact to which F. was liable, combined with his tendency to idealise
and to colour with his own prejudices the characters who
figure in his narrative, are serious deductions from the value of his
work considered as history. <i>The English in Ireland in the Eighteenth
Century</i> appeared in 1872-4. On the death of Carlyle in
1881, F. found himself in the position of his sole literary executor,
and in that capacity <i>pub.</i> successively the <i>Reminiscences</i> (1881),
<i>History of the First Forty Years of Carlyle's Life</i> (1882), <i>Letters and
Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle</i> (1883), <i>History of Carlyle's Life in
London</i> (1884). The opinion is held by many that in the discharge
of the duties entrusted to him by his old friend and master he showed
neither discretion nor loyalty; and his indiscreet revelations and gross
inaccuracies evoked a storm of controversy and protest. F. did not
confine his labours to purely literary effort. In 1874-5 he travelled as
a Government Commissioner in South Africa with the view of fostering
a movement in favour of federating the various colonies there;
in 1876 he served on the Scottish Univ. Commission; in 1884-5 he visited
Australia, and gave the fruit of his observations to the
world in <i>Oceana</i> (1886), and in 1886-7 he was in the West Indies,
and <i>pub.</i> <i>The English in the West Indies</i> (1888). The year 1892 saw
his appointment as Prof. of Modern History at Oxf., and his lectures
there were <i>pub.</i> in his last books, <i>Life and Letters of Erasmus</i> (1894),
<i>English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century</i> (1895), and <i>The Council of
Trent</i> (1896). F. was elected in 1869 Lord Rector of the Univ. of
St. Andrews, and received the degree of LL.D. from Edinburgh in
1884. By his instructions no Biography was to be written.</p><br />

herself in the acquisition of knowledge with life-long evil results
<a name='Page_149'></a>to her health. On his death she supported a large family of brothers
and sisters by teaching. Her early studies had made her familiar
with the literature not only of England but of France, Spain, and
Italy; she had become imbued with German philosophy and mysticism,
and she co-operated with Theodore Parker in his revolt against
the Puritan theology till then prevalent in New England, and became
the conductor of the Transcendentalist organ, <i>The Dial</i>, from
1840-2. She made various translations from the German, and <i>pub.
Summer on the Lakes</i> (1844), and <i>Papers on Literature and Art</i>
(1846). In the same year she went to Europe, and at Rome met the
Marquis Ossoli, an Italian patriot, whom she <i>m.</i> in 1847. She and
her husband were in the thick of the Revolution of 1848-9, and in
the latter year she was in charge of a hospital at Rome. After
the suppression of the Revolution she escaped with her husband
from Italy, and took ship for America. The voyage proved most
disastrous: small-pox broke out on the vessel, and their infant
child <i>d.</i>, the ship was wrecked on Fire Island, near New York, and
she and her husband were lost. Destitute of personal attractions,
she was possessed of a singular power of conciliating sympathy. She
was the intimate friend of Emerson, Hawthorn, Channing, and
other eminent men.</p><br />

<a name='FULLER_THOMAS_1608_1661'></a><p><b>FULLER, THOMAS (1608-1661).</b>
&mdash;Divine and antiquary, <i>s.</i>
of a clergyman of the same name, was <i>b.</i> at Aldwinkle, Northamptonshire.
Possessed of exceptional intelligence and a wonderful
memory, he became a good scholar, and distinguished himself at
Camb., where he was sent. Entering the Church, he obtained rapid
preferment, including the lectureship at the Savoy, and a chaplaincy
to Charles II. He was a voluminous author, his works dealing with
theology, morals, history, and antiquities. Among the chief are
<i>History of the Holy War</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the Crusades (1643), <i>The Holy State and
the Profane State</i> (1642), <i>A Pisgah Sight of Palestine</i> (1650), <i>Church
History of Britain</i>, <i>History of Cambridge University</i> (1655), <i>Worthies
of England</i> (1662), and <i>Good Thoughts in Bad Times</i>. The outstanding
characteristic of F.'s writings is shrewd observation conveyed in
a style of quaint humour. Lamb says, &quot;His conceits are oftentimes
deeply steeped in human feeling and passion.&quot; But in addition
there is much wisdom and a remarkable power of casting his
observations into a compact, aphoristic form. The <i>Worthies</i>,
though far from being a systematic work, is full of interesting biographical
and antiquarian matter which, but for the pains of the
author, would have been lost. Coleridge says of him, &quot;He was incomparably
the most sensible, the least prejudiced great man in an
age that boasted a galaxy of great men.&quot; F., who was of a singularly
amiable character, was a strong Royalist, and suffered the
loss of his preferments during the Commonwealth. They were,
however, given back to him at the Restoration.</p>

&mdash;Novelist and miscellaneous

but while still a young man he went to London and formed
a commercial partnership, which proved unfortunate, and he then
entered Lincoln's Inn to study law. A little before this he had produced
his first book, a poem on the Battle of Largs, which, however,
he soon suppressed. He then went to various parts of the Continent
in connection with certain commercial schemes, and met Lord
Byron, with whom he travelled for some time. Returning home he
<i>pub.</i> <i>Letters from the Levant</i>, which had a favourable reception, and
some dramas, which were less successful. He soon, however, found
his true vocation in the novel of Scottish country life, and his fame
rests upon the <i>Ayrshire Legatees</i> (1820), <i>The Annals of the Parish</i>
(1821), <i>Sir Andrew Wylie</i> (1822), <i>The Entail</i> (1824), and <i>The Provost</i>.
He was not so successful in the domain of historical romance, which
he tried in <i>Ringan Gilbaize</i>, <i>The Spae-wife</i>, <i>The Omen</i>, etc., although
these contain many striking passages. In addition to his novels G.
produced many historical and biographical works, including a <i>Life
of Wolsey</i> (1812), <i>Life and Studies of Benjamin West</i> (1816), <i>Tour of
Asia</i>, <i>Life of Byron</i> (1830), <i>Lives of the Players</i>, and an Autobiography
(1834). In addition to this copious literary output,
G. was constantly forming and carrying out commercial schemes,
the most important of which was the Canada Company, which,
like most of his other enterprises, though conducted with great
energy and ability on his part, ended in disappointment and
trouble for himself. In 1834 he returned from Canada to Greenock,
broken in health and spirits, and <i>d.</i> there in 1839 of paralysis. G.
was a man of immense talent and energy, but would have held a
higher place in literature had he concentrated these qualities upon
fewer objects. Most of his 60 books are forgotten, but some of
his novels, especially perhaps <i>The Annals of the Parish</i>, have deservedly
a secure place. The town of Galt in Canada is named
after him.</p><br />

Apostolic Church, which he joined, and in which he ultimately held
high office. About the time of his leaving Oxf. he had planned his
great work, <i>The History of England from the Accession of James I. to
the Restoration</i>, and the accomplishment of this task he made the
great object of his life for more than 40 years. The first two vols.
appeared in 1863 as <i>The History of England from the Accession of
James I. to the Disgrace of Chief Justice Cooke</i>, and subsequent instalments
appeared under the following titles: <i>Prince Charles and<a name='Page_151'></a>
The Spanish Marriage</i> (1867), <i>England under Buckingham and
Charles I.</i> (1875), <i>Personal Government of Charles I.</i> (1877), <i>The Fall
of the Government of Charles I.</i> (1881); these were in 1883-4 re-issued
in a consolidated form entitled <i>History of England from the Accession
of James I. to the Outbreak of the Civil War</i>. The second section of
the work, <i>History of the Great Civil War</i>, followed in three vols. <i>pub.</i>
in 1886, 1889, and 1891 respectively, and three more vols., <i>History
of the Commonwealth and Protectorate</i> in 1894, 1897, and 1901,
brought the story down to 1656, when the health of the indefatigable
writer gave way, and he <i>d.</i> in 1902. In addition to this monumental
work G. wrote many school and college historical text-books,
and contributed to the Epochs of Modern History Series, <i>The
Thirty Years' War</i> (1874), and <i>The First Two Stuarts</i> (1876); he
also wrote <i>Outlines of English History</i>, three parts (1881-3), and
<i>Students' History of England</i>, three parts (1891). From 1871-85 he
was Prof. of History at King's Coll., London, and lecturer on history
for the London Society for the Extension of Univ. Teaching. He
also ed. many of the historical documents which he unearthed in
his investigations, and many of those issued by the &quot;Camden,&quot;
&quot;Clarendon,&quot; and other societies. He was ed. of <i>The English
Historical Review</i>, and contributed largely to the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>. The sober and unadorned style of G.'s works
did little to commend them to the general reader, but their eminent
learning, accuracy, impartiality, and the laborious pursuit of truth
which they exhibited earned for him, from the first, the respect and
admiration of scholars and serious students of history; and as his
great work advanced it was recognised as a permanent contribution
to historical literature. In 1882 he received a civil list pension, and
was elected to Research Fellowships, first by All Souls' Coll., and
subsequently by Merton. He held honorary degrees from the

was <i>Wives and Daughters</i> (1865), which appeared in the <i>Cornhill<a name='Page_153'></a>

of Miss Austen, and if her style and delineation of character
are less minutely perfect, they are, on the other hand, imbued
with a deeper vein of feeling. She was the friend of <a href='#BRONTE_CHARLOTTE_1816_1855'>Charlotte

&mdash;Theologian, <i>b.</i> at Mayfield
in Essex, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb. His claim to remembrance rests on his
being the reputed author of <i>Eikon Basilik&eacute;</i> (the Royal Image), a
book purporting to be written by Charles I. during his imprisonment,
and containing religious meditations and defences of his
political acts. <i>Pub.</i> immediately after the King's execution, it
produced an extraordinary effect, so much so that Charles II. is
reported to have said that, had it been <i>pub.</i> a week earlier, it would
have saved his father's life. There seems now to be little doubt
that Gauden was the author. At all events he claimed to be
recompensed for his services, and was made Bishop successively of
Exeter and Worcester, apparently on the strength of these claims.
The work passed through 50 ed. within a year, and was answered
by Milton in his <i>Iconoclastes</i> (the Image-breaker).</p><br />

<a name='GAY_JOHN_1685_1732'></a><p><b>GAY, JOHN (1685-1732).</b>
&mdash;Poet and dramatist, <i>b.</i> near
Barnstaple of a good but decayed family. His parents dying while
he was a child he was apprenticed to a silk-mercer in London, but
not liking the trade, was released by his master. In 1708 he <i>pub.</i> a
poem, <i>Wine</i>, and in 1713 <i>Rural Sports</i>, which he dedicated to Pope,
whose friendship he obtained. A little before this he had received
an appointment as sec. in the household of the Duchess of Monmouth.
His next attempts were in the drama, in which he was not
at first successful; but about 1714 he made his first decided hit in
<i>The Shepherd's Week</i>, a set of six pastorals designed to satirise
Ambrose Philips, which, however, secured public approval on their
own merits. These were followed by <i>Trivia</i> (1716), in which he
was aided by Swift, an account in mock heroic verse of the dangers
of the London streets, and by <i>The Fan</i>. G. had always been
ambitious of public employment, and his aspirations were gratified
by his receiving the appointment of sec. to an embassy to Hanover,
which, however, he appears to have resigned in a few months. He
then returned to the drama in <i>What d'ye call It</i>, and <i>Three Hours
after Marriage</i>, neither of which, however, took the public fancy.
In 1720 he <i>pub.</i> a collection of his poems, which brought him &pound;1000,
<a name='Page_154'></a>but soon after lost all his means in the collapse of the South Sea
Company. After producing another drama, <i>The Captive</i>, he <i>pub.</i>
his <i>Fables</i> (1727), which added to his reputation, and soon after, in
1728, achieved the great success of his life in <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>, a
Newgate pastoral, suggested by Swift, in which the graces and
fantasticalities of the Italian Opera were satirised. A sequel, <i>Polly</i>,
was suppressed by the Lord Chamberlain as reflecting upon the
Court, but was <i>pub.</i> and had an enormous sale. The last few
years of his life were passed in the household of the Duke of Queensberry,
who had always been his friend and patron. He <i>d.</i> after
three days' illness, aged 47. G. was an amiable, easy-going man,
who appears to have had the power of attracting the strong attachments
of his friends, among whom were Pope and Swift. He seems
to have been one of the very few for whom the latter had a sincere
affection. He is buried in Westminster Abbey. Of all he has
written he is best remembered by one or two songs, of which the
finest is <i>Black-eyed Susan</i>.</p><br />

<a name='GEDDES_ALEXANDER_1737_1802'></a><p><b>GEDDES, ALEXANDER (1737-1802).</b>

scholar, of Roman Catholic parentage, was <i>b.</i> at Ruthven, Banffshire,
and <i>ed.</i> for the priesthood at the local seminary of Scalan, and
at Paris, and became a priest in his native county. His translation of
the <i>Satires</i> of Horace made him known as a scholar, but his liberality
of view led to his suspension. He then went to London, where he
became known to Lord Petre, who enabled him to proceed with a new
translation of the Bible for English Roman Catholics, which he
carried on as far as Ruth, with some of the Psalms, and which was
<i>pub.</i> in 3 vols. (1792-6). This was followed by <i>Critical Remarks on the
Hebrew Scriptures</i>, in which he largely anticipated the German school
of criticism. The result of this publication was his suspension from
all ecclesiastical functions. G. was also a poet, and wrote <i>Linton:
a Tweedside Pastoral</i>, <i>Carmen Seculare pro Gallica Gente</i> (1790), in
praise of the French Revolution. He <i>d.</i> without recanting, but
received absolution at the hands of a French priest, though public

wrote a Latin <i>History of British Kings</i>. <i>Merlin's Prophecies</i>, long
attributed to him, is now held to be not genuine. The history is
rather a historical romance than a sober history, and gave scandal
to some of the more prosaic chroniclers who followed him. It was

<a name='GIBBON_EDWARD_1737_1794'></a><p><b>GIBBON, EDWARD (1737-1794).</b>
&mdash;Historian, was <i>b.</i> at
Putney of an ancient Kentish family. His <i>f.</i> was Edward G., and
<a name='Page_155'></a>his mother Judith Porten. He was the only one of a family of
seven who survived infancy, and was himself a delicate child with a
precocious love of study. After receiving his early education at
home he was sent to Westminster School, and when 15 was entered
at Magdalen Coll., Oxf., where, according to his own account, he
spent 14 months idly and unprofitably. Oxf. was then at its lowest
ebb, and earnest study or effort of any kind had little encouragement.
G., however, appears to have maintained his wide reading
in some degree, and his study of Bossuet and other controversialists
led to his becoming in 1753 a Romanist. To counteract this his <i>f.</i>
placed him under the charge of <a href='#MALLET_originally_MALLOCH_DAVID_1705_1765'>David Mallet</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), the poet, deist,
and ed. of Bolingbroke's works, whose influence, not unnaturally,
failed of the desired effect, and G. was next sent to Lausanne, and
placed under the care of a Protestant pastor, M. Pavilliard. Various
circumstances appear to have made G. not unwilling to be re-converted
to Protestantism; at all events he soon returned to the
reformed doctrines. At Lausanne he remained for over four years,
and devoted himself assiduously to study, especially of French
literature and the Latin classics. At this time also he became engaged
to Mademoiselle Suzanne Curchod; but on the match being peremptorily
opposed by his <i>f.</i> it was broken off. With the lady, who
eventually became the wife of Necker, and the mother of Madame de
Sta&euml;l, he remained on terms of friendship. In 1758 G. returned to
England, and in 1761 <i>pub.</i> <i>Essai sur l'Etude de la Litt&eacute;rature</i>, translated into English in 1764. About this time he made a tour on the
Continent, visiting Paris, where he stayed for three months, and
thence proceeding to Switzerland and Italy. There it was that,
musing amid the ruins of the Capitol at Rome on October 15, 1764,
he formed the plan of writing the history of the Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire. He returned to England in 1765, and in 1770
his <i>f.</i> <i>d.</i>, leaving him the embarrassed estate of Buriton, which had
been his usual home when in England. With a view to recovering
his affairs, he left his estate and lived in London where, in 1772,
he seriously set himself to realise the great plan which, since its
conception, had never been out of his thoughts. The first chapter was
written three times, and the second twice before he could satisfy
himself that he had found the style suited to his subject. The progress
of the work was delayed by the fact that G. had meanwhile
(1774) entered the House of Commons, where, as member for Liskeard,
he was a steady, though silent, supporter of Lord North in
his American policy. He subsequently sat for Lymington, and held
office as a Commissioner of Trade and Plantations 1779-82. The
first vol. of the <i>Decline and Fall</i> appeared in 1776, and was received
with acclamation, and it was not until some time had elapsed that the
author's treatment of the rise of Christianity excited the attention
and alarm of the religious and ecclesiastical world. When, however,
the far-reaching nature of his views was at length realised, a
fierce and prolonged controversy arose, into which G. himself did
not enter except in one case where his fidelity as an historian was
impugned. The second and third vols. appeared in 1781, and
thereafter (1783) G. returned to Lausanne, where he lived tranquilly
with an early friend, M. Deyverdun, devoting his mornings to
the completion of his history, and his evenings to society. At
<a name='Page_156'></a>length, on the night of June 27, 1787, in the summer-house of his
garden, the last words were penned, and the great work of his life
completed. Of the circumstances, and of his feelings at the moment,
he has himself given an impressive account. The last three vols.
were issued in 1788, G. having gone to London to see them through
the press. This being done he returned to Lausanne where, within
a year, his beloved friend Deyverdun <i>d.</i> His last years were clouded
by ill-health, and by anxieties with regard to the French Revolution.
In 1793, though travelling was a serious matter for him, he came to England
to comfort his friend Lord Sheffield on the death of his
wife, took ill, and <i>d.</i> suddenly in London on January 16, 1794.</p>

<p>The place of G. among historians is in the first rank, and if the
vast scale of his work and the enormous mass of detail involved in
it are considered along with the learning and research employed in
accumulating the material, and the breadth of view, lucidity of
arrangement, and sense of proportion which have fused them into
a distinct and splendid picture, his claims to the first place cannot
be lightly dismissed. His style, though not pure, being tinged with
Gallicisms, is one of the most noble in our literature, rich, harmonious,
and stately; and though sources of information not accessible
to him have added to our knowledge, and have shown some of
his conclusions to be mistaken, his historical accuracy has been
comparatively little shaken, and his work is sure of permanence.
As a man G. seems to have been somewhat calm and cool in his
feelings, though capable of steady and affectionate friendships,
such as those with Deyverdun and the Sheffields, which were warmly
reciprocated, and he appears to have been liked in society, where
his brilliant conversational powers made him shine. He was vain,
and affected the manners of the fine gentleman, which his unattractive
countenance and awkward figure, and latterly his extreme corpulence,
rendered somewhat ridiculous. He left an interesting

<a name='Page_157'></a>followed by another satire, <i>The M&aelig;viad</i>, against some minor
dramatists. His last effort in this line was his <i>Epistle to Peter

friends had just started, and of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (1809-24). He
also brought out ed. of Massinger, Ben Jonson, and Ford. As a
critic he had acuteness; but he was one-sided, prejudiced, and
savagely bitter, and much more influenced in his judgments by the
political opinions than by the literary merits of his victims. In his
whole career, however, he displayed independence and spirit in
overcoming the disadvantages of his early life, as well as gratitude
to those who had served him. He held various appointments

&mdash;Statesman,
scholar, and man of letters, fourth <i>s.</i> of Sir John G., a merchant in
Liverpool, was of Scottish ancestry. He was <i>ed.</i> at Eton and
Christ Church, Oxf. From his youth he was deeply interested in
religious and ecclesiastical questions, and at one time thought of
entering the Church. In 1832 he entered Parliament as a Tory, and
from the first gave evidence of the splendid talents for debate and
statesmanship, especially in the department of finance, which raised
him to the position of power and influence which he afterwards
attained. After holding the offices of Pres. of the Board of Trade,
Colonial Sec., and Chancellor of the Exchequer, he attained the position
of Prime Minister, which he held four times 1868-74, 1880-85,
1885-86, and 1892-93. His political career was one of intense energy
and activity in every department of government, especially after
he became Prime Minister, and while it gained him the enthusiastic
<a name='Page_159'></a>applause and devotion of a large portion of the nation, it exposed
him to a correspondingly intense opposition on the part of another.
The questions which involved him in the greatest conflicts of his life
and evoked his chief efforts of intellect were the disestablishment
of the Irish Church, the foreign policy of his great rival Disraeli, and
Home Rule for Ireland, on the last of which the old Liberal party
was finally broken up. In the midst of political labours which
might have been sufficient to absorb even his tireless energy, he
found time to follow out and write upon various subjects which
possessed a life-long interest for him. His first book was <i>The State
in its Relations with the Church</i> (1839), which formed the subject of
one of Macaulay's essays. <i>Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age</i>
(1858), <i>Juventus Mundi</i> (1869), and <i>Homeric Synchronism</i> (1876),
<i>The Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture</i> (1890), <i>The Vatican Decrees
and Vaticanism</i> (1874-75), and <i>Gleanings of Past Years</i> (1897), 8 vols.,
were his other principal contributions to literature. G.'s scholarship,
though sound and even brilliant, was of an old-fashioned kind,
and his conclusions on Homeric questions have not received much
support from contemporary scholars. In his controversies with
Huxley and others his want of scientific knowledge and of sympathy
with modern scientific tendencies placed him at a disadvantage.
His character was a singularly complex one, and his intellect
possessed a plasticity which made it possible to say of him that he
never <i>was</i> anything, but was always <i>becoming</i> something. His life
was a singularly noble and stainless one, and he must probably ever
remain one of the great figures in the history of his country.</p>

man with a taste for literature, he wrote two poems in blank verse,
<i>Leonidas</i> (1737), and <i>The Athenaid</i> (1787). Though not without a
degree of dignity, they want energy and interest, and are now forgotten.
He also produced a few dramas, which had little success.

<a name='GODWIN_MRS_MARY_WOLLSTONECRAFT_1759_1797'></a><p><b>GODWIN, MRS. MARY (WOLLSTONECRAFT) (1759-1797).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous
writer, was of Irish extraction. Her <i>f.</i> was a spend-thrift
of bad habits, and at 19 Mary left home to make her way
in the world. Her next ten years were spent as companion to a
lady, in teaching a school at Newington Green, and as governess in
the family of Lord Kingsborough. In 1784 she assisted her sister
to escape from a husband who ill-treated her. In 1788 she took to
translating, and became literary adviser to Johnson the publisher,
through whom she became known to many of the literary people of
the day, as well as to certain Radicals, including Godwin, Paine,
Priestly, and Fuseli, the painter. She then, 1792, went to Paris,
where she met Captain Imlay, with whom she formed a connection,
the fruit of which was her daughter Fanny. Captain Imlay having
deserted her, she tried to commit suicide at Putney Bridge, but was
rescued. Thereafter she resumed her literary labours, and lived with
W. Godwin, who married her in 1797. Their <i>dau.</i>, Mary, whose
birth she did not survive, became the second wife of Shelley. Her
chief original writings are a <i>Reply</i> to Burke's <i>Reflections on the French
Revolution</i> (1791), <i>Vindication of the Rights of Women</i> (1792), and
<i>Original Stories for Children</i>, illustrated by W. Blake. Her <i>Vindication</i>
received much adverse criticism on account of its extreme
positions and over-plainness of speech.</p><br />

<a name='GODWIN_WILLIAM_1756_1836'></a><p><b>GODWIN, WILLIAM (1756-1836).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher and
novelist, <i>b.</i> at Wisbeach, and <i>ed.</i> at a school in Norwich, to which
city his <i>f.</i>, a Presbyterian minister, had removed, and subsequently
at a Presbyterian coll. at Hoxton, with a view to the ministry.<a name='Page_161'></a>
From 1778 to 1783 he acted as minister of various congregations
near London; but his theological views having undergone important
changes, he resigned his pastorate, and devoted himself to a literary
career. His first work, a series of historical sketches in the form
of sermons, failed. He then found employment as one of the
principal writers in the <i>New Annual Register</i>, and became otherwise
prominent as an advocate of political and social reform. Many of
his views were peculiar and extreme, and even tended, if fully carried
out in practice, to subvert morality; but they were propounded
and supported by their author with a whole-hearted belief in their
efficacy for the regeneration of society: and the singular circumstances
of his connection with and ultimate marriage to Mary Wollstonecraft
showed at least that he had the courage of his opinions.
His <i>Enquiry concerning Political Justice</i> (1793) made him famous.
A year later he <i>pub.</i> his masterpiece, <i>Caleb Williams</i>, a novel exhibiting
a sombre strength rarely equalled. The next few years
were occupied in political controversy, for which G. was, by his
sincerity and his masculine style, well fitted; and it was in the midst
of these&mdash;in 1797&mdash;that his first marriage, already alluded to, and
the death of his wife, of whom he <i>pub.</i> a singular but interesting Life,
occurred. In 1799 his second great novel, <i>St. Leon</i>, based upon the
philosopher's stone and the elixir of life, appeared. His other
novels, <i>Fleetwood</i> (1804), <i>Mandeville</i> (1817), and <i>Cloudesley</i> (1830),
are much inferior. In addition to these works G. brought out an
elaborate <i>Life of Chaucer</i> in 2 vols. (1803), <i>An Essay on Sepulchres</i>
(1808), containing much fine thought finely expressed, <i>A History of
the Commonwealth</i>, an Essay against the theories of <a href='#MALTHUS_THOMAS_ROBERT_1766_1834'>Malthus</a> (<i>q.v.</i>),
and his last work, <i>Lives of the Necromancers</i>. For some time he
engaged in the publishing business, in which, however, he ultimately
proved unsuccessful. In his later years he had the office of Yeoman
Usher of the Exchequer conferred upon him. G. entered in 1801
into a second marriage with a widow, Mrs. Clairmont, by whom he
had a <i>dau.</i> This lady had already a <i>s.</i> and <i>dau.</i>, the latter of whom
had an irregular connection with Byron. His <i>dau.</i> by his first
marriage&mdash;Mary Wollstonecraft G.,&mdash;became in 1816 the wife of
Shelley. G. was a man of simple manners and imperturbable temper.</p><br />

<a name='GOLDING_ARTHUR_1535_1605'></a><p><b>GOLDING, ARTHUR (1535?-1605?).</b>
&mdash;Translator, <i>s.</i> of a
gentleman of Essex, was perhaps at Camb., and was diligent in the
translation of theological works by Calvin, Beza, and others, but is
chiefly remembered for his versions of C&aelig;sar's <i>Commentaries</i> (1565),
and specially of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> (1565-67), the latter in ballad
metre. He also translated Justin's <i>History</i>, and part of Seneca.</p><br />

<a name='GOLDSMITH_OLIVER_1728_1774'></a><p><b>GOLDSMITH, OLIVER (1728-1774).</b>
&mdash;Poet, dramatist, and
essayist, <i>s.</i> of an Irish clergyman, was <i>b.</i> at Pallasmore in Co. Longford.
His early education was received at various schools at
Elphin, Athlone, and Edgeworthstown. At the age of 8 he had a
severe attack of smallpox which disfigured him for life. In 1744
he went to Trinity Coll., Dublin, whence, having come into collision
with one of the coll. tutors, he ran away in 1746. He was, however,
induced to return, and <i>grad.</i> in 1749. The Church was chosen for
him as a profession&mdash;against his will be it said in justice to him.
He presented himself before the Bishop of Elphin for examination&mdash;perhaps
<a name='Page_162'></a>as a type of deeper and more inward incongruencies&mdash;in
scarlet breeches, and was rejected. He next figured as a tutor;
but had no sooner accumulated &pound;30 than he quitted his employment
and forthwith dissipated his little savings. A long-suffering uncle
named Contarine, who had already more than once interposed on
his behalf, now provided means to send him to London to study
law. He, however, got no farther than Dublin, where he was
fleeced to his last guinea, and returned to the house of his mother,
now a widow with a large family. After an interval spent in idleness,
a medical career was perceived to be the likeliest opening,
and in 1752 he steered for Edin., where he remained on the usual
happy-go-lucky terms until 1754, when he proceeded to Leyden.
After a year there he started on a walking tour, which led him
through France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. How he lived
it is hard to say, for he left Leyden penniless. It is said that he disputed
at Univ., and played the flute, and thus kept himself in existence.
All this time, however, he was gaining the experiences and
knowledge of foreign countries which he was afterwards to turn to
such excellent account. At one of the Univ. visited at this time, he
is believed to have secured the medical degree, of which he subsequently
made use. Louvain and Padua have both been named as the
source of it. He reached London almost literally penniless in 1756,
and appears to have been occupied successively as an apothecary's
journeyman, a doctor of the poor, and an usher in a school at
Peckham. In 1757 he was writing for the <i>Monthly Review</i>. The
next year he applied unsuccessfully for a medical appointment in
India; and the year following, 1759, saw his first important literary
venture, <i>An Enquiry into the State of Polite Learning in Europe</i>. It
was <i>pub.</i> anonymously, but attracted some attention, and brought
him other work. At the same time he became known to Bishop Percy,
the collector of the <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, and he had written
<i>The Bee</i>, a collection of essays, and was employed upon various
periodicals. In 1761 began his friendship with Johnson, which led
to that of the other great men of that circle. His <i>Chinese Letters</i>,
afterwards republished as <i>The Citizen of the World</i>, appeared in <i>The
Public Ledger</i> in 1762. <i>The Traveller</i>, the first of his longer poems,
came out in 1764, and was followed in 1766 by <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>.
In 1768 he essayed the drama, with <i>The Good-natured Man</i>,
which had considerable success. The next few years saw him busily
occupied with work for the publishers, including <i>The History of Rome</i>
(1769), Lives of Parnell the poet, and Lord Bolingbroke (1770), and
in the same year <i>The Deserted Village</i> appeared; <i>The History of
England</i> was <i>pub.</i> in 1771. In 1773 he produced with great success
his other drama, <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>. His last works were <i>The
Retaliation</i>, <i>The History of Greece</i>, and <i>Animated Nature</i>,
all <i>pub.</i> in
1774. In that year, worn out with overwork and anxiety, he
caught a fever, of which he <i>d.</i> April 4. With all his serious and
very obvious faults&mdash;his reckless improvidence, his vanity, and, in
his earlier years at any rate, his dissipated habits&mdash;G. is one of the
most lovable characters in English literature, and one whose writings
show most of himself&mdash;his humanity, his bright and spontaneous
humour, and &quot;the kindest heart in the world.&quot; His friends included
some of the best and greatest men in England, among them<a name='Page_163'></a>
Johnson, Burke, and Reynolds. They all, doubtless, laughed at
and made a butt of him, but they all admired and loved him. At
the news of his death Burke burst into tears, Reynolds laid down
his brush and painted no more that day, and Johnson wrote an
imperishable epitaph on him. The poor, the old, and the outcast
crowded the stair leading to his lodgings, and wept for the benefactor
who had never refused to share what he had (often little enough) with
them. Much of his work&mdash;written at high pressure for the means of
existence, or to satisfy the urgency of duns&mdash;his histories, his
<i>Animated Nature</i>, and such like, have, apart from a certain charm
of style which no work of his could be without, little permanent
value; but <i>The Traveller</i> and <i>The Deserted Village</i>, <i>She Stoops to
Conquer</i>, and, above all, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>, will keep his memory
dear to all future readers of English.</p>

which he had a passion. He betook himself to the Bush, got into
financial trouble, and <i>d.</i> by his own hand. In the main he derives
his inspiration (as in the <i>Rhyme of Joyous Garde</i>, and <i>Britomarte</i>)
from medi&aelig;val and English sources, not from his Australian surroundings.
Among his books are <i>Sea-spray and Smoke-drift</i> (1867),
<i>Bush Ballads</i> (containing <i>The Sick Stock-rider</i>) (1870), <i>Ashtaroth</i>
(1867). In many of his poems, <i>e.g. An Exile's Farewell</i>, and <i>Whispering

pathos.</p><br />

which are now lost, and pastorals; but, moved by a sermon preached
at Paul's Cross in 1577 during a plague, he deserted the theatre, and
became one of its severest critics in his prose satire, <i>The School of
Abrose</i> (1579), directed against &quot;poets, pipers, players, jesters,
and such-like Caterpillars of a Commonwealth.&quot; Dedicated to Sir
P. Sidney, it was not well received by him, and is believed to have
evoked his <i>Apologie for Poetrie</i> (1595). G. entered the Church, and

<a name='GOWER_JOHN_1325_1408'></a><p><b>GOWER, JOHN (1325?-1408).</b>
&mdash;Poet. Although few details
of his life have come down to us, he appears to have been a
man of wealth and importance, connected with Kent, well known at
Court, and in possession of more than one estate. He was the
friend of Chaucer, who gives him the title of &quot;the moral Gower,&quot;
which has clung to him ever since. His first principal work was
<i>Speculum Meditantis</i> (the Mirror of one meditating) written in French
on the subject of married life. It was long believed to have been
lost. It was followed by <i>Vox Clamantis</i> (the Voice of one crying)
written in Latin, giving an account of the peasants' revolt of 1381,
and attacking the misgovernment and social evils which had led
to it. His third, and only English poem, was <i>Confessio Amantis</i>
(Lover's Confession), a work of 30,000 lines, consisting of tales and
meditations on love, written at the request of Richard II. It is the
<a name='Page_165'></a>earliest large collection of tales in the English tongue. In his old age
G. became blind. He had, when about 70, retired to the Priory of St.
Mary Overies, the chapel of which is now the Church of St. Saviour,
Southwark, where he spent his last years, and to which he was a
liberal benefactor. G. represented the serious and cultivated man
of his time, in which he was reckoned the equal of Chaucer, but as a

at school, was destined for the service of the Church, and was for 4
years at Glasgow Univ. while he maintained himself by teaching.
His first poems appeared in the <i>Glasgow Citizen</i>. In 1860, however,
he went with his friend Robert Buchanan to London, where he
soon fell into consumption. He was befriended by Mr. Monckton
Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton, but after a sojourn in the South
of England, returned home to die. His chief poem, <i>The Luggie</i> (the
river of his birthplace) contains much beautiful description; but
his genius reached its highest expression in a series of 30 sonnets
written in full view of an early death and blighted hopes, and bearing

a friend of Horace Walpole), and Camb. After completing his Univ.
course he accompanied Walpole to France and Italy, where he spent
over two years, when a difference arising G. returned to England,
and went back to Camb. to take his degree in law without, however,
any intention of practising. He remained at Camb. for the rest of
his life, passing his time in the study of the classics, natural science,
and antiquities, and in visits to his friends, of whom Walpole was
again one. It was in 1747 that his first poem, the <i>Ode on a Distant<a name='Page_167'></a>
Prospect of Eton College</i>, appeared, and it was followed between 1750
and 1757 by his <i>Pindaric Odes</i>, including <i>The Progress of Poesy</i>,
and <i>The Bard</i>, which were, however, somewhat coldly received.
Nevertheless he had, on the death of Colley Cibber, the offer of
the laureateship, which he declined; but in 1768 he accepted the
Professorship of Modern History in his Univ., worth &pound;400 a year.
Having been drawn to the study of Icelandic and Celtic poetry he
produced <i>The Fatal Sisters</i>, and <i>The Descent of Odin</i>, in which are
apparent the first streaks of the dawn of the Romantic Revival.
G.'s poems occupy little space, but what he wrote he brought to the
highest perfection of which he was capable, and although there is a
tendency on the part of some modern critics to depreciate him, it is
probable that his place will always remain high among all but the
first order of poets. Probably no poem has had a wider acceptance
among all classes of readers than his <i>Elegy in a Country Churchyard</i>.
In addition to his fame as a poet, he enjoys that of one of the greatest
of English letter-writers, and of a really great scholar. He <i>d.</i> at
Camb. after a short illness following upon a gradually declining state
of health.</p>

&mdash;Journalist and miscellaneous
writer, was the <i>s.</i> of a small farmer in New Hampshire. His
early life was passed first as a printer, and thereafter in editorial
work. He started in 1841, and conducted until his death, the <i>New
York Tribune</i>. He was long a leader in American politics, and in
1872 was an unsuccessful candidate for the Presidency. His

&mdash;Historian, was the
<i>s.</i> of a tradesman in Oxf., where he was <i>ed.</i>, first at Magdalen Coll.
School, and then at Jesus Coll. He entered the Church, and served
various cures in London, under a constant strain caused by delicate
health. Always an enthusiastic student of history, his scanty
leisure was devoted to research. In 1869 he finally gave up clerical
work, and received the appointment of librarian at Lambeth. He
had been laying plans for various historical works, including a
History of the English Church as exhibited in a series of Lives of
the Archbishops of Canterbury, and, what he proposed as his <i>magnum
opus</i>, A History of England under the Angevin Kings. The
discovery, however, that his lungs were affected, necessitated the
abridgment of all his schemes, and he concentrated his energies on
the preparation of his <i>Short History of the English People</i>, which
appeared in 1874, and at once gave him an assured place in the first
rank of historical writers. In 1877 he <i>m.</i> Miss Alice Stopford, by
whose talents and devotion he was greatly assisted in carrying out
and completing such work as his broken health enabled him to undertake
during his few remaining years. Abandoning his proposed
history of the Angevins, he confined himself to expanding his <i>Short
History</i> into <i>A History of the English People</i> in 4 vols. (1878-80), and
writing <i>The Making of England</i>, of which one vol. only, coming
down to 828, had appeared when he <i>d.</i> at Mentone in March 1883.
After his death appeared <i>The Conquest of England</i>. The <i>Short<a name='Page_168'></a>
History</i> may be said to have begun a new epoch in the writing of
history, making the social, industrial, and moral progress of the
people its main theme. To infinite care in the gathering and sifting
of his material G. added a style of wonderful charm, and an historical
imagination which has hardly been equalled.</p><br />

travelling in Spain and Italy, he returned to Camb. and took A.M.
Settling in London he was one of the wild and brilliant crew who
passed their lives in fitful alternations of literary production and
dissipation, and were the creators of the English drama. He has
left an account of his career in which he calls himself &quot;the mirror
of mischief.&quot; During his short life about town, in the course of
which he ran through his wife's fortune, and deserted her soon after
the birth of her first child, he poured forth tales, plays, and poems,
which had great popularity. In the tales, or pamphlets as they
were then called, he turns to account his wide knowledge of city
vices. His plays, including <i>The Scottish History of James IV.</i>, and
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>, which are now little read, contain some fine
poetry among a good deal of bombast; but his fame rests, perhaps,
chiefly on the poems scattered through his writings, which are
full of grace and tenderness. G. <i>d.</i> from the effects of a surfeit
of pickled herrings and Rheinish wine. His extant writings are
much less gross than those of many of his contemporaries, and he
seems to have given signs of repentance on his deathbed, as is
evidenced by his last work, <i>A Groat's worth of Wit bought with a
Million of Repentance</i>. In this curious work occurs his famous
reference to Shakespeare as &quot;an upstart crow beautified with our
feathers.&quot; Among his other works may be mentioned <i>Euphues'
censure to Philautus</i>, <i>Pandosto, the Triumph of Time</i> (1588), from
which Shakespeare borrowed the plot of <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, <i>A
Notable Discovery of Coosnage</i>, <i>Arbasto, King of Denmark</i>, <i>Penelope's

many preferments; but after an illness he refused to be longer a
pluralist, and resigned all but a prebend at Lincoln. Later he
was a strenuous and courageous reformer, as is shown by his refusing
in 1253 to induct a nephew of the Pope to a canonry at Lincoln, of
which he had been Bishop since 1235. He was equally bold in
resisting the demand of Henry III. for a tenth of the Church
revenues. Amid his absorbing labours as a Churchman, he found
time to be a copious writer on a great variety of subjects, including
husbandry, physical and moral philosophy, as also sermons, commentaries,

1830. In 1832 he was elected one of the members of Parliament for
the City of London. In 1841 he retired from Parliament, and in 1843
from the bank, thenceforth devoting his whole time to literature,
which, along with politics, had been his chief interest from his
youth. He early came under the influence of Bentham and the
two Mills, and was one of the leaders of the group of theorists
known as &quot;philosophical Radicals.&quot; In 1820 he <i>m.</i> Miss Harriet
Lewin who, from her intellectual powers, was fitted to be his helper

<i>Westminster Review</i> a severe criticism of Mitford's <i>History of Greece</i>,
and in 1845 <i>pub.</i> the first 2 vols. of his own, the remaining 6 vols.
appearing at intervals up to 1856. G. belongs to the school of
philosophical historians, and his <i>History</i>, which begins with the
legends, ends with the fall of the country under the successors of
Alexander the Great. It is one of the standard works on the subject,
which his learning enabled him to treat in a full and thorough
manner; the style is clear and strong. It has been repeatedly
re-issued, and has been translated into French and German. G.

imagination and implanted in his mind the interest in geography
and the lives and adventures of our great navigators and discoverers,
which became the ruling passion of his life; and in order to increase
his knowledge of these matters he studied various foreign languages
and the art of navigation. He took orders, and was chaplain of the
English Embassy in Paris, Rector of Witheringsett, Suffolk, 1590,
Archdeacon of Westminster, 1602, and Rector of Gedney, Lincolnshire,
1612. After a first collection of voyages to America and
the West Indies he compiled, while at Paris, his great work, <i>The

afterwards used (in far inferior style) by <a href='#PURCHAS_SAMUEL_1575_1626'>S. Purchas</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). In all
his work H. was actuated not only by the love of knowledge, but by
a noble patriotism: he wished to see England the great sea-power
of the world, and he lived to see it so. His work, as has been said,

the English ambassador to the Hague in the capacity of chaplain,
and attended the Synod of Dort, where he was converted from
Calvinism to Arminianism. A lover of quiet and learned leisure,
he declined all high and responsible ecclesiastical preferment, and
chose and obtained scholarly retirement in a Fellowship of Eton, of
which his friends Sir Henry Savile and Sir Henry Wotton were successively
Provost. A treatise on <i>Schism and Schismatics</i> (1636?)
gave offence to Laud, but H. defended himself so well that Laud
made him a Prebendary of Windsor. Refusing to acknowledge the
Commonwealth, he was deprived, fell into poverty, and had to sell
his library. After his death his writings were <i>pub.</i> in 1659 as <i>The

&mdash;Novelist,
was <i>b.</i> in Dublin, but left Ireland at the age of 15. Nevertheless,
that country gave her the motive of several of her most successful
books, such as <i>Sketches of Irish Character</i> (1829), <i>Lights and
Shadows of Irish Character</i> (1838), <i>Marian</i> (1839), and <i>The White
Boy</i> (1845). Other works are <i>The Buccaneer</i>, and <i>Midsummer Eve</i>, a
fairy tale, and many sketches in the <i>Art Journal</i>, of which her
husband, SAMUEL CARTER HALL (1800-1889), was ed. With him
she also collaborated in a work entitled <i>Ireland, its Scenery, Character,
<a name='Page_174'></a>etc.</i> Mrs. H. was a very voluminous writer; her descriptive talents
were considerable, as also was her power of depicting character.
Her husband was likewise a writer of some note, chiefly on art.</p><br />

<a name='HALL_BASIL_1788_1844'></a><p><b>HALL, BASIL (1788-1844).</b>
&mdash;Traveller, <i>s.</i> of Sir James H.,
an eminent man of science, was in the navy, and rose to be captain.
He was one of the first to visit Corea, and wrote <i>Voyage of Discovery
to Corea</i> (1818), also <i>Travels in North America in 1827-28</i>, a lively
work which gave some offence in the U.S., <i>Fragments of Voyages
and Travels</i> (1831-40), and some tales and romances. He was
latterly insane.</p><br />

<a name='HALL_or_HALLE_EDWARD_1499_1547'></a><p><b>HALL, or HALLE, EDWARD (1499?-1547).</b>
&mdash;Chronicler, <i>b.</i>
in London, studied successively at Camb. and Oxf. He was a
lawyer, and sat in Parliament for Bridgnorth, and served on various
Commissions. He wrote a history of <i>The Union of the two Noble and
Illustre Families of Lancastre and Yorke</i>, commonly called <i>Hall's
Chronicle</i>. It was <i>pub.</i> after the author's death by Richard Grafton,
and was prohibited by Queen Mary.</p><br />

<a name='HALL_JOSEPH_1574_1656'></a><p><b>HALL, JOSEPH (1574-1656).</b>
&mdash;Divine, <i>b.</i> at Ashby-de-la-Zouche,
and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., he entered the Church, and became in
1627 Bishop of Exeter, and in 1641 Bishop of Norwich. He had a
chequered career. He accompanied James I. to Scotland in 1617,
and was a Deputy to the Synod of Dort. Accused of Puritanism,
and at enmity with Laud, he fell on troublous days, and was, in
1641, imprisoned in the Tower for joining those bishops who protested
against the validity of laws passed during their exclusion
(owing to tumult in the streets) from Parliament. Returning to
Norwich he found that his revenues had been sequestrated, and his
private property seized. In 1647 he retired to a small farm near
Norwich, where he passed the remainder of his life. Among his
works are <i>Contemplations</i>, <i>Characters of Virtues and Vices</i> (1614),
and his <i>Virgidemiarum, or Satires</i> (1597-8), the last written before
he was in orders, and condemned by Archbishop Whitgift to be
burned. Pope, however, thought them &quot;the best poetry and truest
satire in the English language.&quot; H.'s <i>Divine Right of Episcopacy</i>
gave rise to much controversy, in which Archbishop Ussher, Milton,
and the writers who called themselves &quot;Smectymnuus&quot; (a combination
of their initials) took part.</p><br />

<a name='HALL_ROBERT_1764_1831'></a><p><b>HALL, ROBERT (1764-1831).</b>
&mdash;Divine, <i>b.</i> at Arnsby,
Leicestershire, the <i>s.</i> of a Baptist minister of some note, was <i>ed.</i> at a
Baptist Academy, and at the Univ. of Aberdeen, from which he
received the degree of D.D. in 1817. He ministered to congregations
at Bristol, Cambridge, Leicester, and again at Bristol, and became
one of the greatest pulpit orators of his day. His most famous sermon
was that on the <i>Death of the Princess Charlotte</i> (1817). Another
which created a great impression was that on <i>Modern Infidelity</i>. H.
was a life-long sufferer, and was occasionally insane, yet his intellectual
activity was unceasing. After his death a collection of 50
of his sermons was <i>pub.</i> (1843), and <i>Miscellaneous Works and
Remains</i> (1846).</p><br />

<a name='HALLAM_HENRY_1777_1859'></a><p><b>HALLAM, HENRY (1777-1859).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of a Dean
of Wells, was <i>b.</i> at Windsor, and <i>ed.</i> at Eton and Oxf. He was
<a name='Page_175'></a>called to the Bar at the Inner Temple, and appointed a Commissioner
of Stamps. Among his earliest writings were papers in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>; but in 1818 he leaped into a foremost place
among historical writers by the publication of his <i>View of the State
of Europe during the Middle Ages</i>. This was followed in 1827 by
<i>The Constitutional History of England from the Accession of Henry
VII. to the Death of George II.</i>, and his third great work, <i>Introduction
to the Literature of Europe in the 15th, 16th, and 17th Centuries</i>,
in 4 vols., appeared in 1837-39. All these, which have gone through
several ed., and have been translated into the principal languages of
Europe, are characterised by wide and profound learning, indefatigable
research, and judicial impartiality. They opened a new field
of investigation in which their author has had few, if any, superiors.
In politics H. was a Whig; but he took no active share in party
warfare. He had two sons of great promise, both of whom predeceased
him. Of these the elder, ARTHUR HENRY, is the subject of
Tennyson's <i>In Memoriam</i>, and of him his <i>f.</i> wrote a touching
memoir prefixed to his literary remains.</p><br />

Conn., wrote, with Rodman Drake, a young poet who <i>d.</i> at 25, <i>The
Croaker Papers</i>, a series of satirical and humorous verses, and
<i>Fanny</i>, also a satire. In 1822 he visited Europe, and the traces of
this are found in most of his subsequent poetry, <i>e.g.</i> his lines on
Burns, and on Alnwick Castle.</p><br />

intended for the Church, he decided for art and literature. After
working as an artist in the Highlands with his wife, who was a
Frenchwoman, he settled in France, and devoted himself to writing
on art. Among his works are <i>Etching and Etchers, etc.</i> (1868), <i>Painting
in France after the Decline of Classicism</i> (1869), <i>The Intellectual
Life</i> (1873), <i>Human Intercourse</i> (1884), <i>The Graphic Arts</i> (1882),
<i>Landscape</i> (1885), some of which were magnificently illustrated.
He also left an autobiography. His writings had a great influence
upon artists, and also in stimulating and diffusing the love of art
among the public.</p><br />

&mdash;Statesman and
political writer, <i>b.</i> in the West Indies, was one of the framers of the
Constitution of the United States, and was the first Sec. of the
national Treasury. He was one of the greatest of American statesmen,
and has also a place in literature as the principal writer in the
<i>Federalist</i>, a periodical founded to expound and defend the new<a name='Page_176'></a>
Constitution, which was afterwards <i>pub.</i> as a permanent work. He
contributed 51 of its 85 articles.</p><br />

perhaps had some effect in the improvement of certain aspects of
humble domestic life in Scotland. She also wrote <i>Letters on Education</i>,
<i>Essays on the Human Mind</i>, and <i>The Hindoo Rajah</i>.</p><br />

which was received with great favour. He was an officer in the army,
and, on his retirement, settled in Edin., and became a contributor
to <i>Blackwood</i>. He was also the author of <i>Annals of the Peninsular
Campaign</i> (1829), and <i>Men and Manners in America</i> (1833).</p><br />

<a name='HAMILTON_WILLIAM_OF_BANGOUR_1704_1754'></a><p><b>HAMILTON, WILLIAM (OF BANGOUR) (1704-1754).</b>
&mdash;Poet,
was <i>b.</i> at the family seat in Linlithgowshire. Cultivated and brilliant,
he was a favourite of society, and began his literary career by
contributing verses to Allan Ramsay's <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>. He
joined the Pretender in 1745, and celebrated the Battle of Prestonpans
in <i>Gladsmuir</i>. After Culloden he wandered in the Highlands,
where he wrote his <i>Soliloquy</i>, and escaped to France. His friends,
however, succeeded in obtaining his pardon, and he returned to his
native country. In 1750, on the death of his brother, he succeeded
to the family estate, which, however, he did not long live to enjoy.
He is best remembered for his fine ballad of <i>The Braes of Yarrow</i>.
He also wrote <i>The Episode of the Thistle</i>. He <i>d.</i> at Lyons.</p><br />

<a name='HAMILTON_SIR_WILLIAM_1788_1856'></a><p><b>HAMILTON, SIR WILLIAM (1788-1856).</b>
&mdash;Metaphysician, <i>b.</i>
in Glasgow, in the Univ. of which his <i>f.</i> and grandfather successively
filled the Chair of Anatomy and Botany, <i>ed.</i> there and at
Balliol Coll., Oxf., was called to the Scottish Bar, at which he
attained little practice, but was appointed Solicitor of Teinds. In
1816 he established his claim to the baronetcy of H. of Preston. On
the death of Dr. Thomas Brown in 1820, he was an unsuccessful
candidate for the Chair of Moral Philosophy in Edin., but in the
following year he was appointed Prof. of History. It was not until
1829 that he gave full proof of his remarkable powers and attainments
as a philosopher in a famous article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
a critique of Victor Cousin's doctrine of the Infinite. This paper
carried his name over Europe, and won for him the homage of continental
philosophers, including Cousin himself. After this H. continued
to contribute to the <i>Review</i>, many of his papers being translated
into French, German, and Italian. In 1852 they were <i>coll.</i>
with notes and additions, and <i>pub.</i> as <i>Discussions in Philosophy and
Literature</i>, <i>etc.</i> In 1836 H. was elected Professor of Logic and
Metaphysics at Edinburgh, which office he held with great reputation
until his death, after which the lectures he had delivered were
<a name='Page_177'></a>edited and <i>pub.</i> by Prof. Mansel and Veitch. His <i>magnum opus</i>
was his edition of the <i>Works of Dr. Thomas Reid</i>, left unfinished,
and completed by Mansel. H. was the last, and certainly the most
learned and accomplished, of the Scottish school of philosophy,
which he considered it his mission to develop and correlate to the
systems of other times and countries. He also made various
important contributions to the science of logic. During his later
years he suffered from paralysis of one side, which, though it left
his mind unaffected, impaired his powers of work. A Memoir of
H. by Prof. Veitch appeared in 1869.</p><br />

two novels, <i>Singleton Fontenoy</i> (1850), and <i>Eustace Conyers</i> (1855);
also <i>Lectures on Satire and Satirists</i>, and <i>Studies on Thackeray</i>. For

<i>b.</i> at Rome, practically adopted by his aunt, the widow of Aug. H.,
and <i>ed.</i> at Harrow. He was the author of a large number of books,
which fall into two classes: biographies of members and connections
of his family, and descriptive and historical accounts of various
countries and cities. To the first belong <i>Memorials of a Quiet Life</i>
(his adoptive mother's), <i>Story of Two Noble Lives</i> (Lady Canning and
Lady Waterford), <i>The Gurneys of Earlham</i>, and an inordinately
extended autobiography; to the second, <i>Walks in Rome</i>, <i>Walks in
London</i>, <i>Wanderings in Spain</i>, <i>Cities of Northern, Southern, and
Central Italy</i> (separate works), and many others. His writings are
all interesting and informing, but in general suffer from his tendency
to diffuseness.</p><br />

Devonshire, and was the author of a history of Germany. He was
sent by the widow of Sir W. Jones, whose godson he was, to Winchester,
and New Coll., Oxf., in the latter of which he was for some
time a tutor. Entering the Church he became incumbent of the
rural parish of Alton Barnes where, leading an absolutely unselfish
life, he was the father and friend of his parishioners. In addition
to writing in conjunction with his brother <a href='#HARE_JULIUS_CHARLES_1795_1855'>Julius</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Guesses at
Truth</i>, a work containing short essays on multifarious subjects,

<a name='Page_178'></a>old his parents left him to the care of Clotilda Tambroni, female
Prof. of Greek at Bologna. <i>Ed.</i> at Charterhouse and Camb., he
took orders and, in 1832, was appointed to the rich family living of
Hurstmonceau, which Augustus had refused. Here he had <a href='#STERLING_JOHN_1806_1844'>John
Sterling</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) for curate, and Bunsen for a neighbour. He was also
Archdeacon of Lewes and a Chaplain to the Queen. His first work
was <i>Guesses at Truth</i> (1827), jointly with his brother, and he also <i>pub.</i>,
jointly with <a href='#THIRWALL_CONNOP_1797_1875'>Thirlwall</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), a translation of Niebuhr's <i>History of
Rome</i>, wrote <i>The Victory of Faith</i> and other theological books and
pamphlets on Church and other questions, <i>A Life of Sterling</i>, and a

man of strong antipathies, unmethodical, and unpunctual.</p><br />

<a name='HARINGTON_SIR_JOHN_1561_1612'></a><p><b>HARINGTON, SIR JOHN (1561-1612).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous
writer, and translator, <i>b.</i> at Kelston Park near Bath, and <i>ed.</i> at
Eton and Camb., became a courtier of Queen Elizabeth, whose godson
he was. In 1599 he served in Ireland under Essex, by whom
he was knighted on the field, a stretch of authority which was much
resented by the Queen. While there he wrote <i>A Short View of the
State of Ireland</i>, first <i>pub.</i> 1880. He was in repute for his epigrams,
of which some have wit, but others are only indelicate. His translation
of the <i>Orlando Furioso</i> of Ariosto, in the metre of the original,
is a somewhat free paraphrase, and is now superseded. It first
appeared in the form of extracts, which were handed in MS. about
the Court until they reached the Queen, who reprimanded the translator
for corrupting the morals of her ladies by translating the most
unedifying passages, and banished him to his country seat until he
should have translated the whole poem. His most valuable work
is one which was <i>pub.</i> in 1769 by a descendant, under the title of
<i>Nug&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;</i> (Old-time Trifles), a miscellaneous collection from his
writings and papers, containing many things of interest, <i>e.g.</i>, a
minute account of the Queen's last illness, and letters and verses by
her and other eminent persons.</p><br />

<a name='HARLAND_HENRY_1861_1905'></a><p><b>HARLAND, HENRY (1861-1905).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i> of American
parentage at St. Petersburg, and <i>ed.</i> at Rome. Thereafter he went
to Paris, and thence to America, where he graduated at Harvard,
and settled in New York. His literary career falls into two
distinctly marked sections, very diverse in character. During the
first of these he produced, under the pseudonym of &quot;Sidney Luska,&quot;
a series of highly sensational novels, thrown off with little regard to
literary quality, and which it was his wish should be forgotten;
but about 1890 his aspirations underwent a complete change, and he
became an enthusiast in regard to style and the <i>mot propre</i>. The first
novels of this new era, <i>Mademoiselle Miss</i> (1893), <i>Grey Roses</i> (1895),
and <i>Comedies and Errors</i> (1898), though obtaining the approval of
the literary elect, had little general popularity; but the tide turned
with the appearance of <i>The Cardinal's Snuff-box</i> (1900), which was
widely admired. It was followed by <i>The Lady Paramount</i> (1901),
and <i>My Friend Prospero</i> (1903). H. <i>d.</i> at San Remo after a prolonged
illness.</p><br />

<a name='HARRINGTON_JAMES_1611_1677'></a><p><b>HARRINGTON, JAMES (1611-1677).</b>
&mdash;Political theorist, <i>s.</i>
of Sir Sapcotes H., was <i>b.</i> at Upton, Northamptonshire, and <i>ed.</i> at<a name='Page_179'></a>
Oxf., where he was a pupil of Chillingworth. After leaving the university
he travelled on the Continent, visiting, among other places,
The Hague and Venice, where he imbibed republican principles. He
was for some time a groom of the bedchamber to Charles I. On
the outbreak of the Civil War he sided with the Parliament, but
disapproved of the execution of the King, for whom he appears,
notwithstanding his political theories, to have cherished a personal
attachment. Thereafter he withdrew from active life, and devoted
himself to composing his political romance (as it may be called) of
<i>Oceana</i>, which he <i>pub.</i> in 1656, and in which Oceana represents England,
Marpesia Scotland, and Panop&aelig;a Ireland. In this work he
propounds the theory that the natural element of power in states is
property, of which land is the most important. He further endeavoured
to propagate his views by establishing a debating society
called the Rota, and by his conversations with his friends. After
the Restoration he was confined in the Tower, and subsequently at
Plymouth. He issued several defences of <i>Oceana</i>, and made translations
from Virgil. In his later years he laboured under mental
delusions. Aubrey describes him as of middle stature, strong, well-set,
with quick, fiery hazel eyes, and thick curly hair.</p><br />

<a name='HARRIS_JAMES_1709_1780'></a><p><b>HARRIS, JAMES (1709-1780).</b>
&mdash;Grammarian, was a
wealthy country gentleman and member of Parliament, who held
office in the Admiralty and the Treasury. He was the author of a
singular and learned work entitled <i>Hermes, or a Philosophical Inquiry
concerning Universal Grammar</i>. For the purpose which it had
in view it is useless; but it contains much curious matter. His <i>s.</i>
was the eminent diplomatist, James H., 1st Earl of Malmesbury.</p><br />

<a name='HARRIS_JOEL_CHANDLER_1848_1908'></a><p><b>HARRIS, JOEL CHANDLER (1848-1908).</b>
&mdash;Writer of tales,
etc., <i>b.</i> at Eatonton, Georgia, was successively printer, lawyer, and
journalist. He struck out an original line in his stories of animal
life as it presents itself to the mind of the Southern negro, in whose
dialect they are written. These not only achieved and retain an exceptional
popularity among children, to whom they were in the first
instance addressed, but attracted the attention of students of folklore
and anthology. Among his writings are <i>Uncle Remus</i> (1880),
<i>Nights with Uncle Remus</i> (1884), <i>Mr. Rabbit at Home</i> (1895), <i>Aaron
in the Wild Woods</i> (1897), <i>Chronicles of Aunt Minervy Ann</i> (1899), etc.</p><br />

<a name='HARTE_FRANCIS_BRET_1839_1902'></a><p><b>HARTE, FRANCIS BRET (1839-1902).</b>
&mdash;American
humorist, <i>b.</i> in Albany, N.Y., but when still a boy went to California.
He had a somewhat varied career as a teacher, miner, and
journalist, and it is as a realistic chronicler of the gold-field and
an original humorist that his chief literary triumphs were achieved.
Among his best known writings are <i>Condensed Novels</i>, in which he
showed great skill as a parodist, <i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i>, <i>The
Idyll of Red Gulch</i>, and <i>The Heathen Chinee</i>. In 1880 he came to
Glasgow as U.S. Consul, and from 1885 he lived in London. His
writings often show the tenderness and fine feeling that are allied to
the higher forms of humour, and he may be said to have created a
special form of short story in his Californian tales and prose idylls.</p><br />

<a name='HARTLEY_DAVID_1705_1757'></a><p><b>HARTLEY, DAVID (1705-1757).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher, <i>b.</i> at Luddenden,
Yorkshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., studied for the Church, but
<a name='Page_180'></a>owing to theological difficulties turned to medicine as a profession,
and practised with success at various places, including London and
Bath. He also attained eminence as a writer on philosophy, and
indeed may be said to have founded a school of thought based upon
two theories, (1) the Doctrine of Vibrations, and (2) that of Association
of Ideas. These he developed in an elaborate treatise,
<i>Observations on Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations</i>.
Though his system has long been discarded, its main ideas have continued
to influence thought and investigation.</p><br />

<a name='HARVEY_GABRIEL_1545_1630'></a><p><b>HARVEY, GABRIEL (1545?-1630).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a ropemaker,
was <i>b.</i> at Saffron Walden, <i>ed.</i> at Camb., and became the
friend of Spenser, being the Hobbinol of <i>The Shepheard's Calendar</i>.
He wrote various satirical pieces, sonnets, and pamphlets. Vain
and ill-tempered, he was a remorseless critic of others, and was involved
in perpetual controversy, specially with Greene and Nash,
the latter of whom was able to silence him. He wrote treatises on
rhetoric, claimed to have introduced hexameters into English, was
a foe to rhyme, and persuaded Spenser temporarily to abandon it.</p><br />

<a name='HAWES_STEPHEN_d_1523'></a><p><b>HAWES, STEPHEN (<i>d.</i> 1523?).</b>
&mdash;Poet; very little concerning
him is known with certainty. He is believed to have been
<i>b.</i> in Suffolk, and may have studied at Oxf. or Camb. He first
comes clearly into view as a Groom of the Chamber in 1502, in which
year he dedicated to Henry VII. his <i>Pastyme of Pleasure</i>, first
printed in 1509 by Wynkyn de Worde. In the same year appeared
the <i>Convercyon of Swerers</i> (1509), and <i>A Joyful Meditacyon of all
England</i> (1509), on the coronation of Henry VIII. He also wrote the
<i>Exemple of Vertu</i>. H. was a scholar, and was familiar with French

&mdash;Poet and
antiquary, <i>ed.</i> at Cheltenham and Oxf., became parson of Morwenstow,
a smuggling and wrecking community on the Cornish
coast, where he exercised a reforming and beneficent, though extremely
unconventional, influence until his death, shortly before
which he was received into the Roman Catholic Church. He wrote
some poems of great originality and charm, <i>Records of the Western
Shore</i> (1832-36), and <i>The Quest of the Sangraal</i> (1863) among them,
besides short poems, of which perhaps the best known is <i>Shall
Trelawny Die?</i> which, based as it is on an old rhyme, deceived
both Scott and Macaulay into thinking it an ancient fragment.
He also <i>pub.</i> a collection of papers, <i>Footprints of Former Men in
Cornwall</i> (1870).</p><br />

<a name='HAWTHORNE_NATHANIEL_1804_1864'></a><p><b>HAWTHORNE, NATHANIEL (1804-1864).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i> at
Salem, Massachusetts, <i>s.</i>. of a sea captain, who <i>d.</i> in 1808, after
which his mother led the life of a recluse. An accident when at
play conduced to an early taste for reading, and from boyhood he
cherished literary aspirations. His education was completed at
Bowdoin Coll., where he had Longfellow for a fellow-student. After
graduating, he obtained a post in the Custom-House, which, however,
he did not find congenial, and soon gave up, betaking himself
to literature, his earliest efforts, besides a novel, <i>Fanshawe</i>, which
<a name='Page_181'></a>had no success, being short tales and sketches, which, after appearing
in periodicals, were <i>coll.</i> and <i>pub.</i> as <i>Twice-told Tales</i> (1837),
followed by a second series in 1842. In 1841 he joined for a few
months the socialistic community at Brook Farm, but soon tired of
it, and in the next year he <i>m.</i> and set up house in Concord in an old
manse, formerly tenanted by Emerson, whence proceeded <i>Mosses
from an Old Manse</i> (1846). It was followed by <i>The Snow Image</i>
(1851), <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> (1850), his most powerful work, <i>The
House of Seven Gables</i>, and <i>The Blithedale Romance</i> (1852), besides
his children's books, <i>The Wonder Book</i>, and <i>The Tanglewood Tales</i>.
Such business as he had occupied himself with had been in connection
with Custom-House appointments at different places; but in
1853 he received from his friend Franklin Pierce, on his election to
the Presidency, the appointment of United States Consul at Liverpool,
which he retained for four years, when, in consequence of a
threatened failure of health, he went to Italy and began his story
of <i>The Marble Faun</i>, <i>pub.</i> in England in 1860 under the title of <i>The
Transformation</i>. The last of his books <i>pub.</i> during his lifetime was
<i>Our Old Home</i> (1863), notes on England and the English. He had
returned to America in 1860, where, with failing health and powers,
he passed his remaining four years. After his death there were <i>pub.</i>
<i>The Ancestral Footstep</i>, <i>Septimus Felton</i>, <i>Dr. Grimshawe's Secret</i>, and
<i>The Dolliver Romance</i>, all more or less fragmentary. Most of H.'s
work is pervaded by a strong element of mysticism, and a tendency
to dwell in the border-land between the seen and the unseen. His
style is characterised by a distinctive grace and charm, rich, varied,
suggestive, and imaginative. On the whole he is undoubtedly the
greatest imaginative writer yet produced by America.</p>

of which, <i>The First Part of the Life and Reign of King Henry IV.</i>,
was <i>pub.</i> in 1599, and gave such offence to Queen Elizabeth that
the author was imprisoned. He, however, managed to ingratiate
himself with James I. by supporting his views of kingly prerogative.

and novelist, <i>b.</i> in London, was early <i>m.</i> to a Mr. H., but the
union turning out unhappily, she took to the stage, upon which she
appeared in Dublin about 1715. She afterwards settled in London,
and produced numerous plays and novels, into which she introduced
scandalous episodes regarding living persons whose identity was
very thinly veiled, a practice which, along with her political satires,
more than once involved her in trouble, and together with certain
attacks upon Pope, made in concert with Curll the bookseller,
procured for her a place in <i>The Dunciad</i>. Her enemies called her
reputation in question, but nothing very serious appears to have
been proved. She is repeatedly referred to by Steele, and has been
doubtfully identified with his &quot;Sappho.&quot; Some of her works, such
as <i>The History of Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy</i> had great popularity.
Others were <i>The Fair Captive</i> (1721), <i>Idalia</i> (1723), <i>Love in Excess</i>
(1724), <i>Memoirs of a Certain Island adjacent to Utopia</i> (anonymously)
(1725), <i>Secret History of Present Intrigues at the Court of

<a name='HAZLITT_WILLIAM_1778_1830'></a><p><b>HAZLITT, WILLIAM (1778-1830).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and critic, <i>b.</i>
at Maidstone, was the <i>s.</i> of a Unitarian minister. At his father's
request he studied for the ministry at a Unitarian Coll. at Hackney.
His interests, however, were much more philosophical and political
than theological. The turning point in his intellectual development
was his meeting with Coleridge in 1798. Soon after this he
studied art with the view of becoming a painter, and devoted himself
specially to portraiture, but though so good a judge as his friend,
J. Northcote, R.A., believed he had the talent requisite for success,
<a name='Page_183'></a>he could not satisfy himself, and gave up the idea, though always
retaining his love of art. He then definitely turned to literature,
and in 1805 <i>pub.</i> his first book, <i>Essay on the Principles of Human
Action</i>, which was followed by various other philosophical and
political essays. About 1812 he became parliamentary and dramatic
reporter to the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>; in 1814 a contributor to the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>; and in 1817 he <i>pub.</i> a vol. of literary sketches,
<i>The Round Table</i>. In the last named year appeared his <i>Characters
of Shakespeare's Plays</i>, which was severely attacked in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> and <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, to which his democratic
views made him obnoxious. He defended himself in a cutting
<i>Letter to William Gifford</i>, the ed. of the former. The best of H.'s
critical work&mdash;his three courses of Lectures, <i>On the English Poets</i>,
<i>On the English Comic Writers</i>, and <i>On the Dramatic Literature of the
Age of Queen Elizabeth</i>&mdash;appeared successively in 1818, 1819, and
1820. His next works were <i>Table Talk</i>, in which he attacked
Shelley (1821-22), and <i>The Spirit of the Age</i> (1825), in which he
criticised some of his contemporaries. He then commenced what
he intended to be his chief literary undertaking, a life of <i>Napoleon
Buonaparte</i>, in 4 vols. (1828-30). Though written with great
literary ability, its views and sympathies were unpopular, and it
failed in attaining success. His last work was a <i>Life of Titian</i>, in
which he collaborated with Northcote. H. is one of the most subtle
and acute of English critics, though, when contemporaries came
under review, he sometimes allowed himself to be unduly swayed by
personal or political feeling, from which he had himself often suffered
at the hands of others. His chief principle of criticism as avowed
by himself was that &quot;a genuine criticism should reflect the colour,
the light and shade, the soul and body of a work.&quot; In his private
life he was not happy. His first marriage, entered into in 1807,
ended in a divorce in 1822, and was followed by an amour with his
landlady's <i>dau.</i>, which he celebrated in <i>Liber Amoris</i>, a work which
exposed him to severe censure. A second marriage with a Mrs.
Bridgewater ended by the lady leaving him shortly after. The fact
is that H. was possessed of a peculiar temper, which led to his quarrelling
with most of his friends. He was, however, a man of honest
and sincere convictions. There is a <i>coll.</i> ed. of his works, the
&quot;Winterslow,&quot; by A.R. Waller and A. Glover, 12 vols., with introduction
by W.E. Henley, etc.</p><br />

America as manager of a mining company, which failed, and then
turned to literature, and made considerable reputation by a book of
travels, <i>Rapid Journeys across the Pampas and among the Andes</i>
(1827), which was followed by <i>Bubbles from the Brunnens of Nassau</i>
(1834). He was Governor of Upper Canada 1835-37, but was not a
great success. Thereafter he contributed to the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
and <i>repub.</i> his articles as <i>Stokers and Pokers&mdash;Highways and Byways</i>,

Leucadia, Ionian Islands, lost his parents early, and was sent home
to be taken charge of by an aunt in Wales, a Roman Catholic. On
her death, when he was still a boy, he was left penniless, delicate,
and half blind, and after experiencing great hardships, in spite of
which he <i>ed.</i> himself, he took to journalism. Going to New Orleans
he attained a considerable reputation as a writer with a distinctly
individual style. He came under the influence of Herbert Spencer,
and devoted himself largely to the study of social questions. After
spending three years in the French West Indies, he was in 1890 sent
by a publisher to Japan to write a book on that country, and there
he remained, becoming a naturalised subject, taking the name of
Yakomo Koizumi, and marrying a Japanese lady. He lectured on
English literature in the Imperial Univ. at Tokio. Though getting
nearer than, perhaps, any other Western to an understanding of the
Japanese, he felt himself to the end to be still an alien. Among his
writings, which are distinguished by acute observation, imagination,
and descriptive power of a high order, are <i>Stray Leaves from Strange
Literature</i> (1884), <i>Some Chinese Ghosts</i> (1887), <i>Gleanings in Buddha
Fields</i> (1897), <i>Ghostly Japan</i>, <i>Kokoro</i>, <i>Hints and Echoes of Japanese
Inner Life</i>, etc. He was also an admirable letter-writer.</p><br />

Fellow of All Souls. After travelling in Germany and Russia, he
took orders in 1807, and became Rector of the family living of
Hodnet. In 1822, after two refusals, he accepted the Bishopric of
Calcutta, an office in which he showed great zeal and capacity. He
<i>d.</i> of apoplexy in his bath at Trichinopoly in 1826. In addition to
<i>Palestine</i> he wrote <i>Europe</i>, a poem having reference specially to the
Peninsular War, and left various fragments, including an Oriental
romance based on the story of Bluebeard. H.'s reputation now rests
mainly on his hymns, of which several, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>From Greenland's Icy
Mountains</i>, <i>Brightest and Best of the Sons of the Morning</i>, and <i>Holy,
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty</i>, are sung wherever the English

leaving the Univ. he was private sec. to various public men, and in
1841, his circumstances rendering him independent of employment,
he retired to Bishop's Waltham, and devoted himself for 20 years to
<a name='Page_185'></a>study and writing. Appointed, in 1860, Clerk to the Privy Council, he
became known to, and a favourite of, Queen Victoria, who entrusted
him with the task of editing the <i>Speeches and Addresses of the Prince
Consort</i> (1862), and her own book, <i>Leaves from the Journal of our

and there followed, among others, <i>Essays written in the Intervals of
Business</i> (1841), <i>Friends in Council</i>, 4 series (1847-59), <i>Realmah</i>
(1869), and <i>Conversations on War and General Culture</i> (1871). In
history H. wrote <i>The Conquerors of the New World</i> (1848-52), and
<i>The Spanish Conquests in America</i>, 4 vols. (1855-61). He also wrote
a <i>Life of Thos. Brassey</i>, and, as the demand for his historical works
fell off, he <i>repub.</i> parts of them as individual biographies of Las
Casas, Columbus, Pizarro, and Cortez. He also tried the drama,
but without success. His essays are his most successful work, containing
as they do the thoughts and opinions of a shrewd, experienced,
and highly cultivated man, written in what Ruskin called

from Shelley. Her first important work, <i>The Domestic Affections</i>,
appeared in 1812, in which year she was <i>m.</i> to Captain Hemans, an
Irish officer. The union, however, was not a happy one, and her
husband practically deserted her and her five sons in 1818. Her
literary activity was continued during the whole of her short life,
and her works include, <i>The Vespers of Palermo</i>, a drama, which was
not successful, <i>The Forest Sanctuary</i> (1826), her best poem, <i>Records
of Woman</i>, <i>Lays of Leisure Hours</i>, <i>Songs of the Affections</i>, <i>Hymns for
Childhood</i>, and <i>Thoughts during Sickness</i> (1834), her last effort. In
1829 she visited Scotland, where she was the guest of Scott, who
held her in affectionate regard. She also enjoyed the friendship
of Wordsworth. Always somewhat delicate, her health latterly
entirely gave way, and she <i>d.</i> of a decline in 1835. Her shorter
pieces enjoyed much popularity, and still, owing to their grace and

chiefly remembered by his <i>Exposition of the Old and New Testaments</i>,
which he did not live to complete beyond the Acts. The comment
on the Epistles was, however, furnished after his death by 13 Nonconformist

Roman invasion until the reign of Henry VIII. The novelty consisted
in dividing the subjects into different heads, civil history,
military, social, and so on, and following out each of them separately.

James I. made him a Knight of the Bath, and in 1608 he went to the
Continent, where for some years he was engaged in military and
diplomatic affairs, not without his share of troubles. In 1624 he
was <i>cr.</i> an Irish, and a few years later, an English, peer, as Baron H.,
of Cherbury. On the outbreak of the Civil War he sided, though
somewhat half-heartedly, with the Royalists, but in 1644 he surrendered
to the Parliament, received a pension, held various offices,
and <i>d.</i> in 1648. It was in 1624 that he wrote his treatise, <i>De Veritate</i>,
&quot;An empirical theory of knowledge,&quot; in which truth is distinguished
from (1) revelation, (2) the probable, (3) the possible, (4) the
false. It is the first purely metaphysical work written by an
Englishman, and gave rise to much controversy. It was reprinted
in 1645, when the author added two treatises, <i>De Causis Errorum</i>
(concerning the Causes of Errors), and <i>De Religione Laici</i> (concerning
the Religion of a Layman). His other chief philosophical work was
<i>De Religione Gentilium</i> (1663), of which an English translation appeared
in 1705, under the title of <i>The Ancient Religion of the Gentiles
and Cause of their Errors considered</i>. It has been called &quot;the
charter of the Deists,&quot; and was intended to prove that &quot;all religions
recognise five main articles&mdash;(1) a Supreme God, (2) who ought to
be worshipped, (3) that virtue and purity are the essence of that
worship, (4) that sin should be repented of, and (5) rewards and
punishments in a future state.&quot; Among his historical works are
<i>Expeditio Buckinghamii Ducis</i> (1656), a vindication of the Rochelle
expedition, a <i>Life of Henry VIII.</i> (1649), extremely partial to the
King, his <i>Autobiography</i>, which gives a brilliant picture of his
contemporaries, and of the manners and events of his time, and a
somewhat vainglorious account of himself and his doings. He
was also the author of some poems of a metaphysical cast. On

&mdash;Poet, brother of above,
was <i>ed.</i> at Westminster School and Trinity Coll., Camb., where he took
his degree in 1616, and was public orator 1619-27. He became the
friend of Sir H. Wotton, Donne, and Bacon, the last of whom is said
to have held him in such high esteem as to submit his writings to
him before publication. He acquired the favour of James I., who
conferred upon him a sinecure worth &pound;120 a year, and having powerful
friends, he attached himself for some time to the Court in the
hope of preferment. The death of two of his patrons, however, led
him to change his views, and coming under the influence of Nicholas
Ferrar, the quietist of Little Gidding, and of Laud, he took orders in
1626 and, after serving for a few years as prebendary of Layton
Ecclesia, or Leighton Broomswold, he became in 1630 Rector of
Bemerton, Wilts, where he passed the remainder of his life, discharging
the duties of a parish priest with conscientious assiduity. His
health, however, failed, and he <i>d.</i> in his 40th year. His chief
works are <i>The Temple, or Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations</i>
(1634), <i>The Country Parson</i> (1652), and <i>Jacula Prudentium</i>, a collection
of pithy proverbial sayings, the two last in prose. Not <i>pub.</i>
until the year after his death, <i>The Temple</i> had immediate acceptance,
20,000 copies, according to I. Walton, who was H.'s biographer,
having been sold in a few years. Among its admirers were
Charles I., Cowper, and Coleridge. H. wrote some of the most
exquisite sacred poetry in the language, although his style, influenced
by Donne, is at times characterised by artificiality and
conceits. He was an excellent classical scholar, and an accomplished
musician.</p>

<a name='Page_189'></a>he remained for 10 years. Thereafter he went to Camb., took
orders, and was in 1629 presented by Charles I. to the living of Dean
Prior, a remote parish in Devonshire, from which he was ejected in
1647, returning in 1662. In the interval he appears to have lived
in Westminster, probably supported, more or less, by the gifts of
wealthy Royalists. His <i>Noble Numbers or Pious Pieces</i> was <i>pub.</i> in
1647, his <i>Hesperides or Works both Human and Divine</i> in 1648, and
the two together in one vol. in the latter year. Over 60, however,
of the lighter poems included in <i>Hesperides</i> had previously appeared
anonymously in a collection entitled <i>Wit's Recreations</i>. H.'s early
life in London had been a free one, and his secular poems, in which
he appears much more at ease than in his sacred, show him to have
been a thorough Epicurean, though he claims that his life was not
to be judged by his muse. As a lyric poet H. stands in the front
rank for sweetness, grace, and true poetic fire, and some of his love
songs, <i>e.g. Anthea</i>, and <i>Gather ye Rose-buds</i>, are unsurpassed in
their kind; while in such exquisite little poems as <i>Blossoms,
Daffodils</i>, and others he finds a classic expression for his love of
nature and country life. In his epigrams, however, he falls much
below himself. He has been described as &quot;the most frankly pagan
of English poets.&quot;</p>

dexterous and supple courtier. He wrote <i>Memoirs of the Reign of
George II.</i>, which gives a very unfavourable view of the manners and
morals of the Court. It is written in a lively, though often spiteful

of his living of Alresford, and other preferments. After the Restoration
he was made sub-Dean of Westminster, but the failure of his
health prevented further advancement. He was a voluminous

was a friend of Sir Thomas More, and through him gained the
favour of Henry VIII., and was at the Court of Edward VI. and
Mary, for whom, as a young Princess, he had a great regard. Being
a supporter of the old religion, he enjoyed her favour, but on the
accession of Elizabeth, he left the country, and went to Mechlin,
where he <i>d.</i> He was famous as a writer of interludes, a species of composition
intermediate between the old &quot;moralities&quot; and the regular
drama, and displayed considerable constructive skill, and a racy, if
somewhat broad and even coarse, humour. Among his interludes are
<i>The Play of the Wether</i> (1532), <i>The Play of Love</i> (1533), and <i>The
Pardoner and the Frere</i>. An allegorical poem is <i>The Spider and the
Flie</i> (1556), in which the Spider stands for the Protestants, and the
Flie for the Roman Catholics. H. was likewise the author of some
600 epigrams, whence his title of &quot;the old English epigrammatist.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='HEYWOOD_THOMAS_d_1650'></a><p><b>HEYWOOD, THOMAS (<i>d.</i> 1650).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist. Few facts
about him have come down, and these are almost entirely derived
from his own writings. He appears to have been <i>b.</i> in Lincolnshire,
and was a Fellow of Peterhouse, Camb., and an ardent Protestant.
His literary activity extends from about 1600 to 1641, and his production
was unceasing; he claims to have written or &quot;had a main
finger in&quot; 220 plays, of which only a small proportion (24) are
known to be in existence, a fact partly accounted for by many of
them having been written upon the backs of tavern bills, and by the
circumstance that though a number of them were popular, few were
<i>pub.</i> Among them may be mentioned <i>The Four Prentices of London</i>
(1600) (ridiculed in Fletcher's <i>Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>),
<i>Edward IV.</i> (2 parts) in 1600 and 1605, <i>The Royal King and the
Loyal Subject</i> (1637), <i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i> (1603), <i>Rape
of Lucrece</i> (1608), <i>Fair Maid of the Exchange</i> (1607), <i>Love's Mistress</i>
(1636), and <i>Wise Woman of Hogsdon</i> (1638). H. also wrote an
<i>Apology for Actors</i> (1612), a poem, <i>Hierarchy of the Blessed
Angels</i> (1635), and made various translations. He was thoroughly
English in his subjects and treatment, and had invention, liveliness,
and truth to nature, but lacked the higher poetic sense, and of
course wrote far too much to write uniformly well.</p><br />

&mdash;Chronicler, is
believed to have been <i>b.</i> in the West of England, took the monastic
vow (Benedictine), at Chester in 1299, and seems to have travelled
over the North of England. His fame rests on his <i>Polychronicon</i>, a
universal history reaching down to contemporary events. The
work is divided into 7 books and, though of no great value as an
authority, has an interest as showing the state of historical and geographical
<a name='Page_191'></a>knowledge at the time. Written in Latin, it was translated
into English by <a href='#TREVISA_JOHN_of_1326_1412'>John of Trevisa</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) (1387), and printed by
Caxton (1482), and by others. Another translation of the 15th

history.</p><br />

School, and thereafter made a tour in the East. He was the
author of 17 dramatic pieces, some of them, such as his versions of
Voltaire's <i>Zaire</i> and <i>Merope</i>, being adaptations. He also wrote a
quantity of poetry, which, notwithstanding some good passages, is
as a general rule dull and pompous. Having written some satiric
lines on Pope he received in return a niche in <i>The Dunciad</i>, which led
to a controversy, in which H. showed some spirit. Afterwards a
reconciliation took place. He was a friend and correspondent of
Richardson, whose <i>Pamela</i> he highly praised. In addition to his
literary pursuits H. was a great projector, but his schemes were
usually unsuccessful. He was a good and honourable man, but
over-impressed with his own importance.</p><br />

his attention being arrested by social questions, he gave more and
more of his time to the consideration and exposition of these. Open-minded
and altruistic, his books are full of thought and suggestion.
Among his writings may be mentioned <i>Man and his Dwelling-place</i>
(1859), <i>The Mystery of Pain</i> (1866), <i>The Law of Human Life</i> (1874),
<i>Chapters on the Art of Thinking</i> (1879), and <i>Philosophy and Religion</i>

<a name='HOADLEY_BENJAMIN_1676_1761'></a><p><b>HOADLEY, BENJAMIN (1676-1761).</b>
&mdash;Theologian and controversialist,
<i>ed.</i> at Camb., entered the Church, and became Bishop
successively of Bangor, Hereford, Salisbury, and Winchester. He
was a great supporter of the Revolution, and controvertor of the
doctrines of divine right and passive obedience. His works were
generally either the causes of controversy or elicited by it. One of
his sermons, <i>On the Nature of the Kingdom or Church of Christ</i> was
the originating cause of what was known as the Bangorian controversy,
which raged for a long time with great bitterness.</p><br />

<a name='HOBBES_THOMAS_1588_1679'></a><p><b>HOBBES, THOMAS (1588-1679).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher, was <i>b.</i> at
Malmesbury, the <i>s.</i> of a clergyman, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf. Thereafter he
travelled as tutor through France, Italy, and Germany, with William
Lord Cavendish, afterwards 2nd Earl of Devonshire, with whom he
remained as sec. after the completion of the tour. While engaged in
this capacity he became acquainted with Bacon (whose amanuensis
he is said to have been), Herbert of Cherbury, and Ben Jonson. In
1629 he <i>pub.</i> a translation of <i>Thucydides</i>. After the death of his
patron, which took place in 1626, he went in 1628 to Paris, where he
remained for 18 months, and in 1631 he assumed the position of
tutor to his <i>s.</i>, afterwards the 3rd Earl, with whom he went in 1634
to France, Italy, and Savoy. When in Italy he was the friend of<a name='Page_192'></a>
Galileo, Gassendi, and other eminent men. Returning to England
he remained in the Earl's service, and devoted himself to his studies
on philosophy and politics. The commotions of the times, however,
disturbed him; and his Royalist principles, expounded in his
treatise, <i>De Corpore Politico</i>, led to his again, in 1641, leaving England
and going to Paris, where he remained until 1652. While there, he
entered into controversy on mathematical subjects with Descartes,
<i>pub.</i> some of his principal works, including <i>Leviathan</i>, and received,
in 1647, the appointment of mathematical tutor to the Prince of
Wales, afterwards Charles II., who was then in that city. The
views expressed in his works, however, brought him into such unpopularity
that the Prince found it expedient to break the connection,
and H. returned to England. In 1653 he resumed his relations
with the Devonshire family, living, however, in London in habits of
intimacy with Selden, Cowley, and Dr. Harvey. On the Restoration
the King conferred upon him a pension of &pound;100, but like most of
the Royal benefactions of the day, it was but irregularly paid. His
later years were spent in the family of his patron, chiefly at Chatsworth,
where he continued his literary activity until his death,
which occurred in 1679, in his 91st year. H. was one of the most
prominent Englishmen of his day, and has continued to influence
philosophical thought more or less ever since, generally, however,
by evoking opposition. His fundamental proposition is that all
human action is ultimately based upon selfishness (more or less enlightened),
allowing no place to the moral or social sentiments.
Similarly in his political writings man is viewed as a purely selfish
being who must be held in restraint by the strong hand of authority.
His chief philosophical works are <i>De Corpore Politico</i>, already mentioned,
<i>pub.</i> in 1640; <i>Philosophical Rudiments concerning Government
and Society</i>, originally in Latin, translated into English in 1650;
<i>Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth,
Ecclesiastical and Civil</i> (1651); <i>Treatise on Human Nature</i> (1650);
and <i>Letters upon Liberty and Necessity</i> (1654). Generally speaking,
all his works led him into controversy, one of his principal opponents
being Clarendon. The <i>Letters upon Liberty and Necessity</i>, which is
one of the ablest of them, and indeed one of the ablest ever written
on the subject, brought him into collision with Bramhall, Bishop of
Londonderry, whom he completely overthrew. He was not, however,
so successful in his mathematical controversies, one of the
chief of which was on the Quadrature of the Circle. Here his
antagonist was the famous mathematician Wallis, who was able
easily to demonstrate his errors. In 1672, when 84, H. wrote his
autobiography in Latin verse, and in the same year translated 4
books of the <i>Odyssey</i>, which were so well received that he completed
the remaining books, and also translated the whole of the <i>Iliad</i>.
Though accurate as literal renderings of the sense, these works fail
largely to convey the beauties of the original, notwithstanding
which three ed. were issued within 10 years, and they long retained
their popularity. His last work was <i>Behemoth</i>, a history of the
Civil War, completed just before his death, which occurred
at Hardwick Hall, one of the seats of the Devonshire family. Although
a clear and bold thinker, and a keen controversialist, he was
characterised by a certain constitutional timidity believed to
<a name='Page_193'></a>have been caused by the alarm of his mother near the time
of his birth at the threatened descent of the Spanish Armada.
Though dogmatic and impatient of contradiction, faults which
grew upon him with age, H. had the courage of his opinions, which
he did not trim to suit the times.</p>

probably <i>b.</i> in London, where he appears to have spent most of his
life, living in Chester's Inn in the Strand. Originally intended for
the Church, he received an appointment in the Privy Seal Office,
which he retained until 1424, when quarters were assigned him in
the Priory of Southwick, Hants. In 1399 a pension of &pound;10, subsequently
increased to &pound;13, 6s. 8d., had been conferred upon him,
which, however, was paid only intermittently, thus furnishing him
with a perpetual grievance. His early life appears to have been
irregular, and to the end he was a weak, vain, discontented man.
His chief work is <i>De Regimine Principum</i> or <i>Governail of Princes</i>,
written 1411-12. The best part of this is an autobiographical
prelude <i>Mal Regle de T. Hoccleve</i>, in which he holds up his youthful
follies as a warning. It is also interesting as containing, in the MS.
in the British Museum, a drawing of Chaucer, from which all subsequent
portraits have been taken.</p><br />

<a name='HOGG_JAMES_THE_ETTRICK_SHEPHERD_1770_1835'></a><p><b>HOGG, JAMES (THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD) (1770-1835).</b>
&mdash;Poet,
and writer of tales, belonged to a race of shepherds, and began
life by herding cows until he was old enough to be trusted with a
flock of sheep. His imagination was fed by his mother, who was
possessed of an inexhaustible stock of ballads and folk-lore. He
had little schooling, and had great difficulty in writing out his earlier
poems, but was earnest in giving himself such culture as he could.
Entering the service of Mr. Laidlaw, the friend of Scott, he was by
<a name='Page_194'></a>him introduced to the poet, and assisted him in collecting material
for his <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>. In 1796 he had begun to write his songs,
and when on a visit to Edin. in 1801 he <i>coll.</i> his poems under the
title of <i>Scottish Pastorals, etc.</i>, and in 1807 there followed <i>The Mountain
Bard</i>. A treatise on the diseases of sheep brought him &pound;300,
on the strength of which he embarked upon a sheep-farming enterprise
in Dumfriesshire which, like a previous smaller venture in
Harris, proved a failure, and he returned to Ettrick bankrupt.
Thenceforward he relied almost entirely on literature for support.
With this view he, in 1810, settled in Edin., <i>pub.</i> <i>The Forest
Minstrel</i>, and started the <i>Spy</i>, a critical journal, which ran for a
year. In 1813 <i>The Queen's Wake</i> showed his full powers, and finally
settled his right to an assured place among the poets of his country.
He joined the staff of <i>Blackwood</i>, and became the friend of Wilson,
Wordsworth, and Byron. Other poems followed, <i>The Pilgrims of
the Sun</i> (1815), <i>Madoc of the Moor</i>, <i>The Poetic Mirror</i>, and <i>Queen
Hynde</i> (1826); and in prose <i>Winter Evening Tales</i> (1820), <i>The Three
Perils of Man</i> (1822), and <i>The Three Perils of Woman</i>. In his later
years his home was a cottage at Altrive on 70 acres of moorland
presented to him by the Duchess of Buccleuch, where he <i>d.</i> greatly
lamented. As might be expected from his almost total want of
regular education, H. was often greatly wanting in taste, but he had
real imagination and poetic faculty. Some of his lyrics like <i>The
Skylark</i> are perfect in their spontaneity and sweetness, and his
<i>Kilmeny</i> is one of the most exquisite fairy tales in the language.
Hogg was vain and greedy of praise, but honest and, beyond his
means, generous. He is a leading character, partly idealised, partly
caricatured, in Wilson's <i>Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;</i>.</p><br />

with S. in the famous pamphlet on <i>The Necessity of Atheism</i>, he
shared in the expulsion from the Univ. which it entailed, and thereafter
devoted himself to the law, being called to the Bar in 1817. In
1832 he contributed to Bulwer's <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> his <i>Reminiscences
of Shelley</i>, which was much admired. Thereafter he was
commissioned to write a biography of the poet, of which he completed
2 vols., but in so singular a fashion that the material with
which he had been entrusted was withdrawn. The work, which is
probably unique in the annals of biography, while giving a vivid
and credible picture of S. externally, shows no true appreciation of
him as a poet, and reflects with at least equal prominence the
humorously eccentric personality of the author, which renders
it entertaining in no common degree. Other works of H. were
<i>Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff</i>, and a book of travels, <i>Two
Hundred and Nine Days</i> (1827). He <i>m.</i> the widow of Williams,
Shelley's friend, who was drowned along with him.</p><br />

&mdash;Dramatist, <i>s.</i> of a
small shoemaker in London, passed his youth as a pedlar, and as
a Newmarket stable boy. A charitable person having given him
some education he became a schoolmaster, but in 1770 went on the
<a name='Page_195'></a>provincial stage. He then took to writing plays, and was the first
to introduce the melodrama into England. Among his plays, <i>The
Road to Ruin</i> (1792) is the best, and is still acted; others were
<i>Duplicity</i> (1781), and <i>A Tale of Mystery</i>. Among his novels are
<i>Alwyn</i> (1780), and <i>Hugh Trevor</i>, and he wrote the well-known song,
<i>Gaffer Gray</i>. H. was a man of stern and irascible temper, industrious
and energetic, and a sympathiser with the French Revolution.</p><br />

&mdash;Belonged
to a Cheshire family, and is said by
Anthony Wood to have been at one of the Univ., and to have been
a priest. He came to London, and was in the employment of
Reginald Wolf, a German printer, making translations and doing
hack-work. His <i>Chronicles of Englande, Scotlande, and Irelande</i>,
from which Shakespeare drew much of his history, was based to a
considerable extent on the collections of Leland, and he had the
assistance of W. Harrison, R. Stanyhurst, and others. The introductory
description of England and the English was the work of
Harrison, Stanyhurst did the part relating to Ireland, and H. himself
the history of England and Scotland, the latter being mainly
translated from the works of Boece and Major. <i>Pub.</i> in 1577 it had
an eager welcome, and a wide and lasting popularity. A later ed. in
1586 was ed. by J. Hooker and Stow. It is a work of real value&mdash;a
magazine of useful and interesting information, with the authorities
cited. Its tone is strongly Protestant, its style clear.</p><br />

(afterwards the <i>Century Magazine</i>), in which appeared his novels,
<i>Arthur Bonnicastle</i>, <i>The Story of Sevenoaks</i>, <i>Nicholas Minturn</i>.

made in good Elizabethan English, are of Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>,
Plutarch's <i>Morals</i>, Suetonius, Xenophon's <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i>, and Camden's

<a name='HOLMES_OLIVER_WENDELL_1809_1894'></a><p><b>HOLMES, OLIVER WENDELL (1809-1894).</b>
&mdash;Essayist,
novelist, and poet, was <i>b.</i> of good Dutch and English stock at
Camb., Massachusetts, the seat of Harvard, where he graduated in
1829. He studied law, then medicine, first at home, latterly in Paris,
whence he returned in 1835, and practised in his native town. In
1838 he was appointed Prof. of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth
Coll., from which he was in 1847 transferred to a similar
chair at Harvard. Up to 1857 he had done little in literature: his
first book of poems, containing &quot;The Last Leaf,&quot; had been <i>pub.</i>
But in that year the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> was started with Lowell
for ed., and H. was engaged as a principal contributor. In it appeared
the trilogy by which he is best known, <i>The Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table</i> (1857), <i>The Professor</i>, <i>The Poet</i> (1872), all graceful,
<a name='Page_196'></a>allusive, and pleasantly egotistical. He also wrote <i>Elsie Venner</i>
(1861), which has been called &quot;the snake story of literature,&quot; and
<i>The Guardian Angel</i>. By many readers he is valued most for the
poems which lie imbedded in his books, such as &quot;The Chambered
Nautilus,&quot; &quot;The Last Leaf,&quot; &quot;Homesick in Heaven,&quot; &quot;The Voiceless,&quot;
and &quot;The Boys.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='HOME_JOHN_1722_1808'></a><p><b>HOME, JOHN (1722-1808).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist, <i>s.</i> of the Town-Clerk
of Leith, where he was <i>b.</i>, <i>ed.</i> there and at Edin., and entered
the Church. Before doing so, however, he had fought on the
Royalist side in the '45, and had, after the Battle of Falkirk, been
a prisoner in Doune Castle, whence he escaped. His ministerial
life, which was passed at Athelstaneford, East Lothian, was brought
to an end by the action of the Church Courts on his producing the
play of <i>Douglas</i>. This drama, which had been rejected by Garrick,
but brought out in Edin. in 1756, created an immense sensation, and
made its appearance in London the following year. H. then became
private sec. to the Earl of Bute, who gave him the sinecure of Conservator
of Scots Privileges at Campvere in Holland. Thereafter
he was tutor to the Prince of Wales (George III.), who on his accession
conferred upon him a pension of &pound;300. Other plays were <i>The
Siege of Aquileia</i>, <i>The Fatal Discovery</i> (1769), <i>Alonzo</i>, and <i>Alfred</i>
(1778), which was a total failure. He also wrote a <i>History of the
Rebellion</i>. In 1778 he settled in Edin., where he was one of the
brilliant circle of literary men of which Robertson was the centre.
He supported the claims of Macpherson to be the translator of
Ossian.</p><br />

<a name='HONE_WILLIAM_1780_1842'></a><p><b>HONE, WILLIAM (1780-1842).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous writer, <i>b.</i> at
Bath, in his youth became a convinced and active democrat. His
zeal in the propagation of his views, political and philanthropic, was
so absorbing as to lead to a uniform want of success in his business
undertakings. He <i>pub.</i> many satirical writings, which had immense
popularity, among which were <i>The Political House that Jack
Built</i> (1819), <i>The Man in the Moon</i> (1820), <i>The Political Showman</i>
(1821), and <i>The Apocryphal New Testament</i>. For one of his earliest
satires, <i>The Political Litany</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1817, he was prosecuted, but
acquitted. Later he brought out <i>Ancient Mysteries</i> (1823), <i>Every
Day Book</i> (1826-27), <i>Table Book</i> (1827-28), and <i>Year Book</i> (1828).
These works, in which he had the assistance of other writers, are
full of curious learning on miscellaneous subjects, such as ceremonies,
dress, sports, customs, etc. His last literary enterprise was
an ed. of <i>Strutt's Sports and Pastimes</i> (1830). Always a self-sacrificing
and honest man, he was originally an unbeliever, but in his
latter years he became a sincere Christian.</p><br />

<a name='HOOD_THOMAS_1799_1845'></a><p><b>HOOD, THOMAS (1799-1845).</b>
&mdash;Poet and comic writer, <i>s.</i>
of a bookseller in London, where he was <i>b.</i>, was put into a mercantile
office, but the confinement proving adverse to his health, he was
sent to Dundee, where the family had connections, and where he
obtained some literary employment. His health being restored, he
returned to London, and entered the employment of an uncle as an
engraver. Here he acquired an acquaintance with drawing, which
he afterwards turned to account in illustrating his comic writings.<a name='Page_197'></a>
After working for a short time on his own account he became, at the
age of 22, sub-editor of the <i>London Magazine</i>, and made the acquaintance
of many literary men, including De Quincey, Lamb, and
Hazlitt. His first separate publication, <i>Odes and Addresses to Great
People</i>, appeared in 1825, and had an immediate success. Thus
encouraged he produced in the next year <i>Whims and Oddities</i>, and
in 1829, he commenced <i>The Comic Annual</i>, which he continued for 9 years,
and wrote in <i>The Gem</i> his striking poem, <i>Eugene Aram</i>.
Meanwhile he had <i>m.</i> in 1824, a step which, though productive of
the main happiness and comfort of his future life, could not be considered
altogether prudent, as his health had begun to give way, and
he had no means of support but his pen. Soon afterwards the failure
of his publisher involved him in difficulties which, combined with
his delicate health, made the remainder of his life a continual
struggle. The years between 1834 and 1839 were the period of
most acute difficulty, and for a part of this time he was obliged to
live abroad. In 1840 friends came to his assistance, and he was
able to return to England. His health was, however, quite broken
down, but his industry never flagged. During the five years which
remained to him he acted as ed. first of the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>,
and then of <i>Hood's Monthly Magazine</i>. In his last year a Government
pension of &pound;100 was granted to his wife. Among his other
writings may be mentioned <i>Tylney Hall</i>, a novel which had little
success, and <i>Up the Rhine</i>, in which he satirised the English tourist.
Considering the circumstances of pressure under which he wrote, it is
little wonder that much of his work was ephemeral and beneath his
powers, but in his particular line of humour he is unique, while his
serious poems are instinct with imagination and true pathos. A
few of them, such as <i>The Song of the Shirt</i>, and <i>The Bridge of Sighs</i>
are perfect in their kind.</p>

<a name='HOOK_THEODORE_EDWARD_1788_1841'></a><p><b>HOOK, THEODORE EDWARD (1788-1841).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist and
novelist, <i>s.</i> of James H., music-hall composer, was <i>b.</i> in London, and
<i>ed.</i> at Harrow. As a boy he wrote words for his father's comic
dramas. In 1805 he produced a comic opera, <i>The Soldier's Return</i>,
which was followed by <i>Catch Him who Can</i>. Both of them were
highly successful, and were followed by many others. His marvellous
powers as a conversationalist and <i>improvisatore</i> made him a
favourite in the highest circles. In 1812 he received the appointment
of Accountant-General of Mauritius, which he held for 5
years, when serious irregularities were discovered, and he was sent
home in disgrace, prosecuted by Government for a claim of &pound;12,000,
and imprisoned. It subsequently appeared that the actual peculation
had been the work of a subordinate, and that H. himself was
only chargeable with gross neglect of duty, but though he was
released the claims against him were not departed from. He then
became ed. of <i>John Bull</i>, a journal of high Tory and aristocratic proclivities,
which he conducted with great ability; he also ed. the <i>New Monthly
Magazine</i>, and wrote many novels, among which were
<i>Sayings and Doings</i> (3 series), <i>Gilbert Gurney</i>, and <i>Jack Brag</i>.
Though making a large income, he was always in difficulties, and,

and Oxf. Entering the Church, he held various benefices,
and became Vicar of Leeds (where, largely owing to his exertions, 20
new churches and many schools were built), and afterwards Dean
of Chichester. Besides his labours as a churchman he was a voluminous
author, his works including <i>Church Dictionary</i> (1842), <i>Dictionary
of Ecclesiastical Biography</i> (1845-52), and <i>Lives of the Archbishops
of Canterbury</i> (1860-75), on which he was still engaged at
his death, and which he had brought down to Juxon, vol. xi. His
sermon <i>Hear the Church</i> (1838), in which he affirmed the Apostolical
succession of the Anglican episcopate, attracted much attention.</p><br />

<a name='HOOKER_RICHARD_1554_1600'></a><p><b>HOOKER, RICHARD (1554?-1600).</b>
&mdash;Theologian, <i>b.</i> near
Exeter, of a family the original name of which was Vowell. His ability
and gentleness as a schoolboy recommended him to the notice of
Bishop Jewel, who sent him to Corpus Christi Coll., Oxf., where
he graduated and became a Fellow in 1577. His proficiency in
Hebrew led to his appointment in 1579 as Deputy Prof. Two years
later, 1581, he took orders, and soon thereafter advantage was taken
of his simplicity to entrap him into an unsuitable marriage with a
woman named Joan Churchman, whose mother had nursed him in
an illness. As might have been expected, the connection turned
out unhappily, his wife being a scold, and, according to Anthony
Wood, &quot;a silly, clownish woman.&quot; His fate may, however, have
been mitigated by the fact that his own temper was so sweet that he
is said never to have been seen angry. Some doubt, moreover, has
been cast on some of the reported details of his domestic life. In 1584
he received the living of Drayton-Beauchamp, in Bucks, and in the
following year was appointed Master of the Temple. Here he had
for a colleague as evening lecturer Walter Travers, a man of mark
among the Puritans. Though both men were of the finest moral
character, their views on ecclesiastical questions were widely
different, and as neither was disposed to conceal his opinions, it
came to be said that in the Temple &quot;the pulpit spake pure Canterbury
in the morning and Geneva in the afternoon.&quot; Things developed
into an animated controversy, in which H. was considered
to have triumphed, and the Archbishop (Whitgift) suspended
Travers. The position, however, had become intolerable for H. who
respected his opponent in spite of their differences, and he petitioned
Whitgift that he might retire to the country and find time and
quiet to complete his great work, the <i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i>, on which
he was engaged. He was accordingly, in 1591, presented to the
living of Boscombe near Amesbury, and made sub-Dean and a
minor Prebendary of Salisbury. Here he finished <i>The Four Books of
the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Polity</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1594. The following year
he was presented by Queen Elizabeth to the living of Bishopsbourne,
Kent. Here the fifth book was <i>pub.</i> (1597), and here he <i>d.</i> in 1600.
The sixth and eighth books were not <i>pub.</i> until 1648, and the seventh
only appeared in 1662. The <i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i> is one of the
greatest achievements alike in English theology and English literature,
<a name='Page_199'></a>a masterpiece of reasoning and eloquence, in a style stately
and sonorous, though often laborious and involved. Hallam considered
that no English writer had better displayed the capacities
of the language. The argument is directed against the Romanists
on the one hand and the Puritans on the other, and the fundamental
idea is &quot;the unity and all embracing character of law as the manifestation
of the divine order of the universe.&quot; The distinguishing
note of H.'s character was what Fuller calls his &quot;dove-like simplicity.&quot;
Izaak Walton, his biographer, describes him as &quot;an
obscure, harmless man, in poor clothes, of a mean stature and
stooping ... his body worn out, not with age, but study, and
holy mortification, his face full of heat-pimples ... and tho' not
purblind, yet short, or weak, sighted.&quot; In his calling as a parish
priest he was faithful and diligent. In preaching &quot;his voice was
low ... gesture none at all, standing stone-still in the pulpit.&quot;
The sixth book of the <i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i> has been considered of
doubtful authority, and to have no claim to its place, and the
seventh and eighth are believed to have been put together from
rough notes. Some of his MSS. were destroyed after his death by
his wife's relatives. The epithet &quot;judicious&quot; attached to his name
first appears in the inscription on his monument at Bishopsbourne.</p>

<a name='HOPE_THOMAS_1770_1831'></a><p><b>HOPE, THOMAS (1770-1831).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and writer on art,
was a wealthy merchant of Amsterdam, of Scotch descent, his
family having emigrated to Holland in the 17th century. In early
life he spent much time in travel, studying architecture, and collecting
objects of art. Returning, he settled in London, and occupied
himself in arranging his vast collections. In 1807 he <i>pub.</i> a work on
<i>Household Furniture and Decoration</i>, which had a great effect in improving
the public taste in such matters. This was followed by
two magnificent works, <i>On the Costume of the Ancients</i> (1809), and
<i>Designs of Modern Costumes</i> (1812). Up to this time his reputation
had been somewhat that of a transcendent upholsterer, but in 1819
he astonished the literary world by his novel, <i>Anastasius; or,
Memoirs of a Modern Greek</i>, a work full of imagination, descriptive
power, and knowledge of the world. This book, which was <i>pub.</i>
anonymously, was attributed to Byron, and only credited to the
author on his avowing it in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>. H. also wrote
a treatise on the <i>Origin and Prospects of Man</i>, and <i>Essays on Architecture</i>.

<a name='Page_200'></a>youth of adventure, partly in the Mexican Navy, he returned to
England, and began in 1828 a highly combative literary career with
a poem, <i>Hecatompylos</i>, in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>. His next appearance, <i>The
False Medium</i> (1833), an exposition of the obstacles thrown in the
way of &quot;men of genius&quot; by literary middlemen, raised a nest of

farthing, followed. His plays, which include <i>Cosmo de Medici</i>
(1837), <i>The Death of Marlowe</i> (1837), and <i>Judas Iscariot</i>, did not add
greatly to his reputation. In <i>The New Spirit of the Age</i> (1844), he

of which he was admitted to orders without the usual preliminaries,
and in 1833 obtained a benefice in London and a prebend in St.
Paul's, and was senior assistant in the printed books department
of the British Museum (1824-60). He wrote an <i>Introduction

in London, and <i>ed.</i> privately and at Camb. He sat in the House
of Commons for Pontefract from 1837-63, when he was raised to
the Peerage. His interests were, however, mainly literary and
philanthropic, and it was said of him that he &quot;knew everybody
worth knowing at home and abroad;&quot; and his sympathies being of
the widest, he was able to bring together the most opposite extremes
of life and opinion. He championed the cause of oppressed nationalities,
and of the slave. He <i>pub.</i> many vols. of poetry, among
which were <i>Poetry for the People</i> (1840), and <i>Palm Leaves</i> (1848).
He also wrote a Life of Keats, and various books of travels. Though
he had not the depth of mind or intensity of feeling to make a great
poet, his verse is the work of a man of high culture, graceful and
refined, and a few of his shorter poems&mdash;such as <i>The Beating of my

Oliver Cromwell made him his resident chaplain at Whitehall, a
position which he retained under Richard C., so long as the latter
held the office of Protector. On the Restoration H. returned to
Great Torrington, from which, however, he was ejected in 1662.
Thereafter he wandered from place to place, preaching in secret until
1671, when he went to Ireland as chaplain to Lord Massareene, and
in 1675 he became minister of a dissenting congregation in London.
In 1685 he travelled with Lord Wharton on the Continent, but returned
in 1687 to London, where he <i>d.</i> in 1705. H. was the author
of many excellent works of practical divinity, among which are <i>The
Living Temple</i>, <i>Inquiry into the Doctrine of the Trinity</i>, and <i>The
Divine Presence</i>. The substance of his writings is better than their
style, which is involved and extremely diffuse, and evinces much
vigour of mind. H. is described as of a fine presence and dignified
manners.</p><br />

He was a writer of alliterative verse, referred to by Andrew of
Wyntoun. If he be identified with Sir Hugh, he was an Ayrshire
nobleman related to Robert II., <i>b.c.</i> 1300-20, Chamberlain of Cunningham,
Justiciar of Lothian, and Commissioner for the Borders.

was a clerk in the Ordnance Office, then sec. for the Commission of
the Peace. He contributed to the <i>Spectator</i>, <i>Tatler</i>, and <i>Guardian</i>,
ed. Spenser, and wrote several dramas, of which the best is <i>The
Siege of Damascus</i>. It was his last, he having <i>d.</i> on the first night of

&mdash;Novelist and biographer,
<i>s.</i> of a Berkshire squire, was <i>ed.</i> at Rugby and Oxf., and
called to the Bar in 1848. Much the most successful of his books
was <i>Tom Brown's School-days</i> (1856), which had an immense popularity,
and perhaps remains the best picture of English public-school
life in the language. Its sequel, <i>Tom Brown at Oxford</i> (1861), was
a comparative failure, but his <i>Scouring of the White Horse</i> deals in
a charming way with his own countryside. He also wrote Lives of
Alfred the Great, Bishop Fraser, and D. Macmillan, the publisher.
H. devoted much attention to philanthropic work in conjunction
with Kingsley and Maurice. In 1882 he was appointed a County

<a name='HUME_DAVID_1711_1776'></a><p><b>HUME, DAVID, (1711-1776).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher and historian,
second <i>s.</i> of Joseph H., of Ninewells, Berwickshire, was <i>b.</i> and
<i>ed.</i> in Edin., and was intended for the law. For this, however, he
had no aptitude, and commercial pursuits into which he was initiated
in a counting-house in Bristol proving equally uncongenial, he was
permitted to follow out his literary bent, and in 1734 went to
France, where he passed three years at Rheims and La Fl&egrave;che in
study, living on a small allowance made him by his <i>f.</i> In 1739 he
<i>pub.</i> anonymously his <i>Treatise on Human Nature</i>, which attracted
little attention. Having returned to Scotland, he wrote at Ninewells
his <i>Essays, Moral and Philosophical</i> (1741-42). He now became
desirous of finding some employment which would put him in a position
of independence, and having been unsuccessful in his candidature
for the Chair of Moral Philosophy in Edin., he became in 1745
governor to the Marquis of Annandale, a nobleman whose state was
little removed from insanity. Two years later he accepted the more
congenial appointment of Judge-Advocate-General to General St.
Clair on his expedition to Port L'Orient, and in 1748 accompanied
him on a diplomatic mission to France, whence he passed on to
Vienna and Turin. About the same time he produced his <i>Philosophical
Essays</i> (1748), including the famous <i>Essay in Miracles</i>
which gave rise to so much controversy. These were followed in
1751 by his <i>Enquiry into the Principles of Morals</i>, which he considered
his best work; and in 1752 by his <i>Political Discourses</i>, which
alone of his works had an immediate success. In the same year he
applied unsuccessfully for the Chair of Logic in Glasgow, but was
appointed Keeper of the Advocates' Library in Edin. The access to
books and original authorities which this position gave him appears
to have suggested to his mind the idea of writing a history, and the
first vol. of his <i>History of England</i>, containing the reigns of James I.
and Charles I., was <i>pub.</i> in 1754. Its reception was not favourable,
and the disappointment of the author was so great that, had it not
been for the state of war between the two countries, he would have
left his native land, changed his name, and settled permanently in
France. The second vol., which appeared in 1757, dealing with the
Commonwealth, and the reigns of Charles II. and James II., had a
better reception, and had the effect of &quot;buoying up its unfortunate
brother.&quot; Thereafter the tide completely turned, and the remaining
four vols., 1759 and 1762, in which he turned back and
finished the history from the invasion of Julius C&aelig;sar to the
accession of Henry VII., attained a vast popularity, which extended
to the whole work. During the progress of the history
H. <i>pub.</i> in 1757 <i>Four Dissertations: the Natural History of
Religion; of the Passions; of Tragedy; of the Standard of Taste</i>.
Two others on <i>Suicide</i> and on <i>The Immortality of the Soul</i> were
cancelled, but <i>pub.</i> posthumously. In 1763 H. accompanied<a name='Page_204'></a>
Lord Hertford to Paris, and for a few months acted as <i>Charg&eacute;
d'Affaires</i>. While there he was introduced to the brilliant
literary society for which the French capital was then famous.
Among other acquaintances which he made was that of Rousseau,
whom he persuaded to accompany him on his return home, and for
whom he procured a pension. The suspicious and fickle character
of R., however, soon brought the friendship to an end. Soon
after his return H. received a pension, and from 1767-68 he was
under-sec. to General Conway, then Sec. of State. In 1769 he retired,
and returned to Edin. with an income of &pound;1000 a year which,
time and place considered, was an ample competence, and there he
spent the remainder of his days, the recognised head of the intellectual
and literary society of the city.</p>

<p>The mind of H. was one of the most original and operative of his
age. His philosophy was largely a questioning of the views of previous
metaphysicians, and he occupied towards mind, considered as a self-subsisting
entity, a position analogous to that assumed by Berkeley
towards matter similarly considered. He profoundly influenced
European thought, and by indirectly calling into being the philosophy
of Kant on the one hand, and that of the Scottish School on
the other, created a new era of thought. As a historian he showed
the same originality. He introduced a new and higher method of
writing history than had previously been practised. Until his time
chronicles and contemporary memoirs had, generally speaking, been
all that had been produced; and though his great work cannot,
from its frequent inaccuracies and the fact that it is not based upon
original documents, claim the character of an authority, its clear,
graceful, and spirited narrative style, and its reflection of the individuality
of the writer, constitute it a classic, and it must always
retain a place among the masterpieces of historical literature. In
character H. was kindly, candid, and good-humoured, and he was
beloved as a man even by many who held his views in what was
little short of abhorrence.</p>

made &quot;master of the children&quot; of the Chapel Royal. He wrote

<a name='HUNT_JAMES_HENRY_LEIGH_1784_1859'></a><p><b>HUNT, JAMES HENRY LEIGH (1784-1859).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and
poet, was <i>b.</i> at Southgate, and <i>ed.</i> at Christ's Hospital. A selection
of his earliest poems was <i>pub.</i> by his <i>f.</i> in 1801 under the title of
<i>Juvenilia</i>. In 1805 he joined his brother John in conducting a
paper, the <i>News</i>, which the latter had started. Thereafter the
brothers embarked upon the <i>Examiner</i>, a paper of pronounced
Radical views. The appearance in this journal of an article on the
Prince Regent in which he was described in words which have
been condensed into &quot;a fat Adonis of fifty,&quot; led to H. being
fined &pound;500 and imprisoned for two years. With his customary
genial philosophy, however, the prisoner made the best of
things, turned his cell into a study, with bookcases and a piano,
and his yard into a garden. He had the sympathy of many, and
received his friends, including Byron, Moore, and Lamb. On his
release he <i>pub.</i> his poem, <i>The Story of Rimini</i>. Two other vols. of
poetry followed, <i>The Feast of the Poets</i> and <i>Foliage</i>, in 1814 and 1818
respectively. In the latter year he started the <i>Indicator</i>, a paper
something in the style of the <i>Spectator</i> or <i>Tatler</i>, and after this had
run its course the <i>Companion</i>, conceived on similar lines, took its
place in 1828. In 1822 H. went to Italy with Byron, and there
established the <i>Liberal</i>, a paper which did not prove a success. Disillusioned
with Byron, H. returned home, and <i>pub.</i> in 1828 <i>Lord
Byron and his Contemporaries</i>, a work which gave great offence to
Byron's friends, who accused the author of ingratitude. In 1834
H. started the <i>London Journal</i>, which he ed. for two years. Among
his later works are <i>Captain Sword and Captain Pen</i> (1835), <i>The
Palfrey</i>, a poem, <i>A Legend of Florence</i> (drama), <i>Imagination and
Fancy</i> (1844), <i>Wit and Humour</i> (1846), <i>A Jar of Honey from Mount
Hybla</i> (1848), <i>The Old Court Suburb</i> (1855), <i>The Town</i>, <i>Sir Ralph
Esher</i>, a novel, and his Autobiography (1850). Although his poems
have considerable descriptive power and brightness, he had not
the depth and intensity to make a poet, and his reputation rests
rather upon his essays, which are full of a genial philosophy,
and display a love of books, and everything pleasant and beautiful.
He did much to popularise the love of poetry and literature
in general among his fellow-countrymen.</p><br />

In 1729 he became Prof. of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow, where
he exercised a great influence over his students, and also upon the
Scottish system of philosophy. In his philosophical views he was
to some extent a disciple of Shaftesbury. He introduced the term,<a name='Page_206'></a>
&quot;moral sense,&quot; which he defined as a power of perceiving moral
attributes in action. His <i>System of Moral Philosophy</i> appeared

John, afterwards Colonel, Hutchinson, one of those who signed the
death-warrant of Charles I., but who afterwards protested against
the assumption of supreme power by Cromwell. She has a place in
literature for her Life of her husband, one of the most interesting
biographies in the language, not only on account of its immediate
subject, but of the light which it throws upon the characteristics and
conditions of the life of Puritans of good family. Originally intended
for her family only, it was printed by a descendant in 1806,
and did much to clear away the false impressions as to the narrowness
and austerity of the educated Puritans which had prevailed.
Colonel H. and his wife were noble representatives of their class.</p><br />

and assisted Walter Bagehot in ed. the <i>National Review</i>. In 1861 he

writings may be mentioned <i>Essays, Theological and Literary</i> (1871),
<i>Modern Guides of English Thought</i> (1887), and <i>Contemporary Thought

<a name='HUXLEY_THOMAS_HENRY_1825_1895'></a><p><b>HUXLEY, THOMAS HENRY (1825-1895).</b>
&mdash;Scientific writer,
<i>s.</i> of an assistant master in a public school, was <i>b.</i> at Ealing. From
childhood he was an insatiable reader. In his 13th year he became
a medical apprentice, and in 1842 entered Charing Cross Hospital.
Thereafter he was for a few months surgeon on board the <i>Victory</i> at
Haslar, and was then appointed surgeon on H.M.S. <i>Rattlesnake</i>,
which was sent to make surveys at Torres Strait. While in this
position he made numerous observations, which he communicated
to the Linn&aelig;an Society. In 1851 he became a Fellow of the Royal
Society, and in 1854 Prof. of Natural History at the School of
Mines. Henceforth his life was a very full one, divided between
scientific investigation and public work. He was recognised as the
foremost English biologist, and was elected Pres. of the Royal Society
1883. He served on the London School Board and on various Royal
Commissions. His writings are in the main distinguished by a
clearness, force, and charm which entitle them to a place in literature;
and besides the addition which they made to the stock of
human knowledge, they did much to diffuse a love and study of
science. H. was a keen controversialist, contending for the strictly
scientific view of all subjects as distinguished from the metaphysical
or theological, and accordingly encountered much opposition, and a
good deal of abuse. Nevertheless, he was not a materialist, and was
in sympathy with the moral and tender aspects of Christianity. He
<a name='Page_207'></a>was a strong supporter of the theory of evolution. Among the more
eminent of his opponents were Bishop Wilberforce and Mr. Gladstone.
His <i>pub.</i> works, including scientific communications, are
very numerous. Among the more important are those on the
<i>Medus&aelig;</i>, <i>Zoological Evidences of Man's Place in Nature</i> (1863),
<i>Elementary Lessons on Physiology</i> (1866), <i>Evolution and Ethics</i> (1893),
<i>Collected Essays</i> (9 vols. 1893-4). He was also an admirable letter-writer,
as appears from the <i>Life and Letters</i>, ed. by his son, and to
him we owe the word, and almost the idea, &quot;Agnostic.&quot;</p><br />

acquainted with Inchbald the actor, who <i>m.</i> her in 1772. Seven
years later her husband <i>d.</i>, and for the next ten years she was on the

and Art</i> (1796), which have been frequently reprinted. She also
made a collection of plays, <i>The Modern Theatre</i>, in 10 vols. Her

He claimed to have discovered the MSS. in the house of a gentleman
of fortune. The forgeries included various deeds, a Protestant
confession of faith by Shakespeare, letters to Ann Hathaway,<a name='Page_208'></a>
Southampton, and others, a new version of <i>King Lear</i>, and a complete
drama, <i>Vortigern and Rowena</i>. He completely deceived his <i>f.</i>
and various men of letters and experts, but was detected by Malone,
and the representation of <i>Vortigern</i> on the stage completed the exposure.
I. then tried novel-writing, in which he failed. He <i>pub.</i> a

<a name='IRVING_EDWARD_1792_1834'></a><p><b>IRVING, EDWARD (1792-1834).</b>
&mdash;Theologian and orator,
<i>b.</i> at Annan, Dumfriesshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Edin. Univ., for some years
thereafter was engaged in teaching at Kirkcaldy. Ordained to the
ministry of the Church of Scotland he became, in 1819, assistant to
Dr. Chalmers in Glasgow, after which he went to the Scotch Church in
Hatton Gardens, London, where he had an almost unprecedented
popularity, his admirers including De Quincey, Coleridge, Canning,
Scott, and others. The effect of his spoken oratory is not preserved
in his writings, and was no doubt in a considerable degree
due to his striking appearance and fine voice. He is described as
&quot;a tall, athletic man, with dark, sallow complexion and commanding
features; long, glossy black hair, and an obvious squint.&quot; Soon
after removing to a new church in Regent Square he began to develop
his views relative to the near approach of the Second Advent;
and his <i>Homilies on the Sacraments</i> involved him in a charge of heretical
views on the person of Christ, which resulted in his ejection from
his church, and ultimately in his deposition from the ministry.
Thereafter his views as to the revival, as in the early Church, of the
gifts of healing and of tongues, to which, however, he made no
personal claim, underwent rapid development, and resulted in the
founding of a new communion, the Catholic Apostolic Church, the
adherents of which are commonly known as &quot;Irvingites.&quot; Whether
right or mistaken in his views there can be no doubt of the personal
sincerity and nobility of the man. His <i>pub.</i> writings include <i>For
the Oracles of God</i>, <i>For Judgment to Come</i>, and <i>The Last Days</i>, and
contain many passages of majestic eloquence.</p><br />

<a name='IRVING_WASHINGTON_1783_1859'></a><p><b>IRVING, WASHINGTON (1783-1859).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and historian,
<i>b.</i> in New York, <i>s.</i> of William I. who had emigrated from
Scotland. He was in his youth delicate, and his education was
somewhat desultory, but his <i>f.</i> had a fine library, of which he had
the run, and he was an omnivorous reader. In 1799 he entered a
law office, but a threatening of consumption led to his going, in 1804,
on a European tour in search of health. On his return in 1806 he
was admitted to the Bar. He did not, however, prosecute law, but
joined his brothers in business as a sleeping partner, while he devoted
himself to literature. In 1807 he conducted <i>Salmagundi</i>, an
amusing miscellany, and in 1809 appeared <i>A History of New York
by Diedrich Knickerbocker</i>, a burlesque upon the old Dutch settlers,
which has become a classic in America. He made in 1815 a second
visit to Europe, from which he did not return for 17 years. In
England he was welcomed by Thomas Campbell, the poet, who introduced
him to Scott, whom he visited at Abbotsford in 1817. The
following year the firm with which he was connected failed, and he
had to look to literature for a livelihood. He produced <i>The Sketch-Book</i>
(1819), which was, through the influence of Scott, accepted by<a name='Page_209'></a>
Murray, and had a great success on both sides of the Atlantic. In
1822 he went to Paris, where he began <i>Bracebridge Hall</i>, followed in
1824 by <i>Tales of a Traveller</i>. In 1826 Everett, the American
minister at Madrid, invited him to come and assist him by making
translations relative to Columbus, which opened up to him a new
field hitherto little cultivated. The result was a series of fascinating
historical and romantic works, beginning with <i>History of the Life and

1829, and to America in 1832. In 1842 he was appointed Minister
to Spain, and in 1846 he finally returned to America. In the same
year he <i>pub.</i> a <i>Life of Goldsmith</i>, and his great work, the <i>Life of
Washington</i>, came out 1855-59, <i>Wolfert's Roost</i>, a collection of tales
and essays, appeared in 1855. I. was never <i>m.</i>: in his youth he had
been engaged to a girl who <i>d.</i>, and whose memory he faithfully
cherished. His last years were spent at Sunnyside, an old Dutch
house near his &quot;sleepy hollow,&quot; and there he <i>d.</i> suddenly on Nov.
28, 1859. Though not, perhaps, a writer of commanding power or
originality, I., especially in his earlier works, imparted by his style
and treatment a singular charm to every subject he touched, and
holds a high place among American men of letters, among whom
he is the first who has produced what has, on its own merits,
living interest in literature. He was a man of high character and
amiable disposition.</p><br />

<a name='JAMES_I_KING_of_SCOTLAND_1394_1437'></a><p><b>JAMES I., KING of SCOTLAND (1394-1437).</b>
&mdash;Poet, the
third <i>s.</i> of Robert III., was <i>b.</i> at Dunfermline. In 1406 he was sent
for safety and education to France, but on the voyage was taken
prisoner by an English ship, and conveyed to England, where
until 1824 he remained confined in various places, but chiefly in the
Tower of London. He was then ransomed and, after his marriage
to Lady Jane or Joan Beaufort, <i>dau.</i> of the Duke of Somerset, and the
heroine of <i>The King's Quhair</i> (or Book), crowned at Scone. While in
England he had been carefully <i>ed.</i>, and on his return to his native
country endeavoured to reduce its turbulent nobility to due subjection,
and to introduce various reforms. His efforts, however,
which do not appear to have been always marked by prudence,
ended disastrously in his assassination in the monastery of the Black
Friars, Perth, in February, 1437. J. was a man of great natural
capacity both intellectual and practical&mdash;an ardent student and a
poet of no mean order. In addition to <i>The King's Quhair</i>, one of
the finest love poems in existence, and <i>A Ballad of Good Counsel</i>,
which are very generally attributed to him, he has been more doubtfully
credited with <i>Peeblis to the Play</i> and <i>Christis Kirke on the

many years British Consul at various places in the United States
and on the Continent. At an early age he began to write romances,
and continued his production with such industry that his works
reach to 100 vols. This excessive rapidity was fatal to his permanent
<a name='Page_210'></a>reputation; but his books had considerable immediate popularity.
Among them are <i>Richelieu</i> (1829), <i>Philip Augustus</i> (1831), <i>The Man

attention by a letter in the <i>Times</i> on the Wiltshire labourer. Thereafter
he wrote for the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, in which appeared his
<i>Gamekeeper at Home</i>, and <i>Wild Life in a Southern County</i> (1879),

<a name='JEFFREY_FRANCIS_1773_1850'></a><p><b>JEFFREY, FRANCIS (1773-1850).</b>
&mdash;Critic and political
writer, <i>s.</i> of a legal official, <i>b.</i> in Edinburgh, <i>ed.</i> at the High School
there, and at Glasgow and Oxf., where, however, he remained for a
few months only. Returning to Edinburgh he studied law, and was
called to the Bar in 1794. Brought up as a Tory, he early imbibed
Whig principles, and this, in the then political state of Scotland,
together with his strong literary tendencies, long hindered his professional
advancement. Gradually, however, his ability, acuteness,
and eloquence carried him to the front of his profession. He was
elected Dean of the Faculty of Advocates in 1829 and, on the accession
to power of the Whigs in 1830, became Lord Advocate, and had a
large share in passing the Reform Bill, in so far as it related to Scotland.
In 1832 he was elected M.P. for Edinburgh, and was raised
to the Bench as Lord Jeffrey in 1834. His literary fame rests on his
work in connection with the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, which he edited
from its commencement in 1802 until 1829, and to which he
was a constant contributor. The founding of this periodical by
a group of young men of brilliant talents and liberal sympathies,
among whom were Brougham, Sydney Smith, and F. Horner,
constituted the opening of a new epoch in the literary and
political progress of the country. J.'s contributions ranged
over literary criticism, biography, politics, and ethics and,
especially in respect of the first, exercised a profound influence;
he was, in fact, regarded as the greatest literary critic of his
age, and although his judgments have been far from universally
supported either by the event or by later critics, it remains true
that he probably did more than any of his contemporaries to diffuse
a love of literature, and to raise the standard of public taste in such
matters. A selection of his papers, made by himself, was <i>pub.</i> in 4
vols. in 1844 and 1853. J. was a man of brilliant conversational
powers, of vast information and sparkling wit, and was universally
admired and beloved for the uprightness and amiability of his character.</p><br />

then became apprentice to a printer, devoting all his spare time to
self-education. He early began to contribute to periodicals, and in his
18th year he was engaged by the Coburg Theatre as a writer of short
dramatic pieces. In 1829 he made a great success by his drama of
<i>Black-eyed Susan</i>, which he followed up by <i>The Rent Day</i>, <i>Bubbles of
the Day</i>, <i>Time works Wonders</i>, etc. In 1840 he became ed. of a publication,
<i>Heads of the People</i>, to which Thackeray was a contributor,
and in which some of the best of his own work appeared. He was
one of the leading contributors to <i>Punch</i>, in which <i>Mrs. Caudle's

when he resigned his appointment, and came home to study mathematics
and economics. While in Australia he had been a contributor
to the <i>Empire</i> newspaper, and soon after his return home
he <i>pub.</i> <i>Remarks on the Australian Goldfields</i>, wrote in various
scientific periodicals, and from time to time <i>pub.</i> important papers
on economical subjects. The position which he had attained as a
scientific thinker and writer was recognised by his being appointed
in 1863 tutor, and in 1866, Prof. of Logic, Political Economy, and
Mental and Moral Philosophy in Owen's Coll., Manchester. In 1864
he <i>pub.</i> <i>Pure Logic</i> and <i>The Coal Question</i>; other works were
<i>Elementary Lessons in Logic</i> (1870), <i>Principles of Science</i> (1874), and
<i>Investigations in Currency and Finance</i> (1884), posthumously. His
valuable and promising life was brought to a premature close by his
being drowned while bathing. His great object in his writings was
to place logic and economics in the position of exact sciences, and in
all his work he showed great industry and care combined with
unusual analytical power.</p><br />

Of humble extraction, he was <i>ed.</i> at St. Paul's School and Camb.,
and took orders. He attacked James II. in <i>Julian the Apostate</i> (1682),
and was imprisoned. He continued, however, his attacks on the
Government by pamphlets, and did much to influence the public
<a name='Page_213'></a>mind in favour of the Revolution. Dryden gave him a place in

<a name='JOHNSON_SAMUEL_1709_1784'></a><p><b>JOHNSON, SAMUEL (1709-1784).</b>
&mdash;Moralist, essayist, and
lexicographer, <i>s.</i> of a bookseller at Lichfield, received his early
education at his native town, and went in 1728 to Oxf., but had,
owing to poverty, to leave without taking a degree. For a short
time he was usher in a school at Market Bosworth, but found the
position so irksome that he threw it up, and gained a meagre livelihood
by working for a publisher in Birmingham. In 1735, being
then 26, he <i>m.</i> Mrs. Porter, a widow of over 40, who brought him
&pound;800, and to whom he was sincerely attached. He started an
academy at Ediol, near Lichfield, which, however, had no success,
only three boys, one of whom was <a href='#GARRICK_DAVID_1717_1779'>David Garrick</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), attending it.
Accordingly, this venture was given up, and J. in 1737 went to
London accompanied by Garrick. Here he had a hard struggle with
poverty, humiliation, and every kind of evil, always, however,
quitting himself like the true man he was. He contributed to the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, furnishing the parliamentary debates in
very free and generally much improved form, under the title of
&quot;Debates of the Senate of Lilliput.&quot; In 1738 appeared <i>London</i>, a
satire imitated from Juvenal which, <i>pub.</i> anonymously, attracted
immediate attention, and the notice of Pope. His next work was
the life of his unfortunate friend <a href='#SAVAGE_RICHARD_1697_1743'>Savage</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) (1744); and in 1747
he began his great <i>English Dictionary</i>. Another satire, <i>The Vanity
of Human Wishes</i>, appeared in 1749, and in the same year <i>Irene</i>, a
tragedy. His next venture was the starting of the <i>Rambler</i>, a paper
somewhat on the lines of the <i>Spectator</i>; but, sententious and grave,
it had none of the lightness and grace of its model, and likewise
lacked its popularity. It was almost solely the work of J. himself,
and was carried on twice a week for two years. In 1752 his wife,
&quot;his dear Tetty&quot; <i>d.</i>, and was sincerely mourned; and in 1755 his
<i>Dictionary</i> appeared. The patronage of <a href='#CHESTERFIELD_PHILIP_DORMER_STANHOPE_4TH_EARL_OF_1694_1773'>Lord Chesterfield</a> (<i>q.v.</i>),
which he had vainly sought, was then offered, but proudly rejected
in a letter which has become a classic. The work made him famous,
and Oxf. conferred upon him the degree of M.A. He had become
the friend of Reynolds and Goldsmith; Burke and others were soon
added. The <i>Idler</i>, a somewhat less ponderous successor of the
<i>Rambler</i>, appeared in 1758-60, and <i>Rasselas</i>, his most popular work,
was written in 1759 to meet the funeral expenses of his mother, who
then <i>d.</i> at the age of 90. At last the tide of his fortunes turned. A
pension of &pound;300 was conferred upon him in 1762, and the rest of his
days were spent in honour, and such comfort as the melancholy to
which he was subject permitted. In 1763 he made the acquaintance,
so important for posterity, of James Boswell; and it was probably
in the same year that he founded his famous &quot;literary club.&quot;
In 1764 he was introduced to Mr. Thrale, a wealthy brewer, and for
many years spent much of his time, an honoured guest, in his family.
The kindness and attentions of Mrs. T., described by Carlyle as &quot;a
bright papilionaceous creature, whom the elephant loved to play
with, and wave to and fro upon his trunk,&quot; were a refreshment and
<a name='Page_214'></a>solace to him. In 1765 his ed. of Shakespeare came out, and his
last great work was the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, in 10 vols. (1779-81). He
had in 1775 <i>pub.</i> his <i>Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland</i>, an account
of a tour made in the company of Boswell. His last years
were darkened by the loss of friends such as Goldsmith and Thrale,
and by an estrangement from Mrs. T., on her marriage with Piozzi,
an Italian musician. Notwithstanding a lifelong and morbid fear of
death, his last illness was borne with fortitude and calmness, soothed
by the pious attentions of Reynolds and Burke, and he <i>d.</i> peacefully
on December 13, 1784. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, and
a monument in St. Paul's was erected by the &quot;club.&quot; Statues of
him were also erected in Lichfield and Uttoxeter. He had received
from Oxf. and Dublin the degree of LL.D.</p>

<p>Though of rough and domineering manners, J. had the tenderest
of hearts, and his house was for years the home of several persons,
such as Mrs. Williams and Levett, the surgeon, who had no claim
upon him but their helplessness and friendlessness. As Goldsmith
aptly said, he &quot;had nothing of the bear but his skin.&quot; His outstanding
qualities were honesty and courage, and these characterise
all his works. Though disfigured by prejudice and, as regards
matters of fact, in many parts superseded, they remain, as has been
said, &quot;some excellent, all worthy and genuine works;&quot; and he will
ever stand one of the greatest and most honourable figures in the
history of English literature. Boswell's marvellous <i>Life</i> has made
J.'s bodily appearance, dress, and manners more familiar to posterity
than those of any other man&mdash;the large, unwieldy form, the face
seamed with scrofula, the purblind eyes, the spasmodic movements,
the sonorous voice, even the brown suit, metal buttons, black
worsted stockings, and bushy wig, the conversation so full of matter,
strength, sense, wit, and prejudice, superior in force and sparkle to
the sounding, but often wearisome periods of his written style. Of
his works the two most important are the <i>Dictionary</i>, which, long
superseded from a philological point of view, made an epoch in the
history of the language, and the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, many of them
deformed by prejudice and singularly inadequate criticism, others,
almost perfect in their kind, and the whole written in a style less
pompous and more natural and lively than his earlier works.</p>

escaped by benefit of clergy. About the same time he joined the
Roman Catholic Church, in which he remained for 12 years. It
was in 1598 also that his first successful play, <i>Every Man in his
Humour</i>, was produced, with Shakespeare as one of the players.
<i>Every Man out of his Humour</i> (1599), <i>Cynthia's Revels</i> (1600), and
<i>The Poetaster</i> (1601), satirising the citizens, the courtiers, and the
poets respectively, followed. The last called forth several replies,
the most notable of which was the <i>Satiromastix</i> (Whip for the Satirist)
of <a href='#DEKKER_THOMAS_1570_1641'>Dekker</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), a severe, though not altogether unfriendly, retort,
which J. took in good part, announcing his intention of leaving off
satire and trying tragedy. His first work in this kind was <i>Sejanus</i>
(1603), which was not very favourably received. It was followed
by <i>Eastward Ho</i>, in which he collaborated with Marston and Chapman.
Certain reflections on Scotland gave offence to James I., and
the authors were imprisoned, but soon released. From the beginning
of the new reign J. devoted himself largely to the writing of
Court masques, in which he excelled all his contemporaries, and
about the same time entered upon the production of the three great
plays in which his full strength is shown. The first of these, <i>Volpone,
or the Fox</i>, appeared in 1605; <i>Epic&aelig;ne, or the Silent Woman</i> in 1609,
and <i>The Alchemist</i> in 1610. His second and last tragedy, <i>Catiline</i>,
was produced in 1611. Two years later he was in France as companion
to the son of Sir W. Raleigh, and on his return he held up
hypocritical Puritanism to scorn in <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, which was
followed in 1616 by a comedy, <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. In the same
year he <i>coll.</i> his writings&mdash;plays, poems, and epigrams&mdash;in a folio
entitled his <i>Works</i>. In 1618 he journeyed on foot to Scotland,
where he was received with much honour, and paid his famous
visit to <a href='#DRUMMOND_WILLIAM_1585_1649'>Drummond</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) at Hawthornden. His last successful
play, <i>The Staple of Newes</i>, was produced in 1625, and in the
same year he had his first stroke of palsy, from which he never
entirely recovered. His next play, <i>The New Inn</i>, was driven from
the stage, for which in its rapid degeneracy he had become too
learned and too moral. A quarrel with Inigo Jones, the architect,
who furnished the machinery for the Court masques, lost him Court
favour, and he was obliged, with failing powers, to turn again to the
stage, for which his last plays, <i>The Magnetic Lady</i> and <i>The Tale of a
Tub</i>, were written in 1632 and 1633. Town and Court favour, however,
turned again, and he received a pension of &pound;100; that of the
best poets and lovers of literature he had always kept. The older poets
were his friends, the younger were proud to call themselves, and
be called by him, his sons. In 1637, after some years of gradually
failing health, he <i>d.</i>, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. An
admirer caused a mason to cut on the slab over his grave the well-known
inscription, &quot;O Rare Ben Jonson.&quot; He left a fragment, <i>The
Sad Shepherd</i>. His works include a number of epigrams and translations,
<a name='Page_217'></a>collections of poems (<i>Underwoods</i> and <i>The Forest</i>); in prose
a book of short essays and notes on various subjects, <i>Discoveries</i>.</p>

<p>J. was the founder of a new style of English comedy, original,
powerful, and interesting, but lacking in spontaneity and nature.
His characters tend to become mere impersonations of some one
quality or &quot;humour,&quot; as he called it. Thus he is the herald, though a
magnificent one, of decadence. He painted in general with a powerful,
but heavy hand; in his masques, however, he often shows a singular
gracefulness, especially in the lyrics which he introduces. His
character, as given by Drummond, is not a particularly attractive
one, &quot;a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner
of others, given rather to lose a friend than a jest, jealous of every
word and action of those about him, especially after drink ... a
dissembler of ill parts which reign in him, a bragger of some good
that he wanteth ... passionately kind and angry ... oppressed
with fantasy which hath ever mastered his reason.&quot; There must,
however, have been far other qualities in a man who could command,
as J. undoubtedly did, the goodwill and admiration of so many of
the finest minds of his time. In person he was tall, swarthy, marked
with small-pox, and in later years burly.</p>

Camberwell, and <i>ed.</i> at St. Paul's School and Balliol Coll., where he
had a distinguished career, becoming Fellow 1838, Tutor 1840, and
Master 1870. He held the Regius Professorship of Greek 1855-93,
though for the first 10 years he was, owing to the opposition of his
theological opponents in the Univ., deprived of a large part of the
usual emoluments. He was a keen and formidable controversialist,
and was usually found on what was, for the time, the unpopular
side. His contribution (an essay on <i>The Interpretation of Scripture</i>)
to the famous <i>Essays and Reviews</i>, which appeared in 1860, brought
him into strong collision with powerful sections of theological
opinion, to which he had already given offence by his commentaries
on the <i>Epistles to the Thessalonians, Galatians, and Romans</i>. His
views were, indeed, generally considered to be extremely latitudinarian.
Latterly he exercised an extraordinary influence in the
Univ., and was held in reverence by his pupils, many of whom have
<a name='Page_218'></a>risen to eminence. His chief works are translations, with learned
introductions, of <i>The Dialogues</i> of Plato, of Thucydides, and of the
<i>Politics</i> of Aristotle. He also, in conjunction with Prof. Campbell,
brought out an ed. of <i>The Republic</i> of Plato. He held the degree of
LL.D. from the Univ. of Edin. (1884), and Camb. (1890), and Doctor
of Theology of Leyden (1875).</p><br />

<a name='KAMES_HENRY_HOME_LORD_1696_1782'></a><p><b>KAMES, HENRY HOME, LORD (1696-1782).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous
writer, <i>s.</i> of Geo. H., of Kames, Berwickshire, was admitted
an advocate in 1723, and raised to the Bench in 1752. In 1748 he
<i>pub.</i> a collection of Decisions of the Court of Session. It is, however,
on his philosophical and historical writings that his literary fame
rests. His writings include <i>Essays on the Principles of Morality and
Natural Religion</i> (1751), <i>The Elements of Criticism</i> (1762), in which
he sought for principles based on the elements of human nature;
<i>Sketches of the History of Man</i> (1774), and <i>Loose Hints on Education</i>,
in which many modern views are anticipated. In all these works,
while the style is stiff and crabbed, there is much original thought.

he in 1777 <i>pub.</i> a work entitled <i>The Gentleman Farmer</i>.</p><br />

After serving for some time in the Bengal Artillery, he succeeded
J.S. Mill as sec. to the political and secret department in the
East India Office. His first literary work was a novel <i>pub.</i> in 1845,
and he then began his valuable series of histories and biographies
illustrative of the British occupation of India, including <i>The War in
Afghanistan</i> (1851), and <i>The Sepoy War in India</i>, which he did not
live to finish, and which was completed by G.B. Malleson as <i>The
History of the Indian Mutiny</i> (6 vols., 1890); also histories of the
East India Company and of Christianity in India, and Lives of Sir
John Malcolm and other Indian soldiers and statesmen. All his
writings are characterised by painstaking research, love of truth,
and a style suited to the importance of his subjects. He was made

<a name='KEATS_JOHN_1795_1821'></a><p><b>KEATS, JOHN (1795-1821).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of the chief servant
at an inn in London, who <i>m.</i> his master's <i>dau.</i>, and <i>d.</i> a man of some
substance. He was sent to a school at Enfield, and having meanwhile
become an orphan, was in 1810 apprenticed to a surgeon at
Edmonton. In 1815 he went to London to walk the hospitals. He
was not, however, at all enthusiastic in his profession, and having
become acquainted with Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, Shelley, and others, he
gave himself more and more to literature. His first work&mdash;some sonnets&mdash;appeared
in Hunt's <i>Examiner</i>, and his first book, <i>Poems</i>, came
out in 1817. This book, while containing much that gave little promise
of what was to come, was not without touches of beauty and music,
but it fell quite flat, finding few readers beyond his immediate circle.
<i>Endymion</i>, begun during a visit to the Isle of Wight, appeared in
1818, and was savagely attacked in <i>Blackwood</i> and the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>. These attacks, though naturally giving pain to the poet,
were not, as was alleged at the time, the cause of his health breaking
down, as he was possessed of considerable confidence in his own
powers, and his claim to immortality as a poet. Symptoms of hereditary
consumption, however, began to show themselves and, in the
hope of restored health, he made a tour in the Lakes and Scotland,
from which he returned to London none the better. The death soon
after of his brother Thomas, whom he had helped to nurse, told upon
his spirits, as did also his unrequited passion for Miss Fanny Brawne.
In 1820 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Lamia and Other Poems</i>, containing <i>Isabella</i>, <i>Eve of
St. Agnes</i>, <i>Hyperion</i>, and the odes to the <i>Nightingale</i> and <i>The
Grecian Urn</i>, all of which had been produced within a period of
about 18 months. This book was warmly praised in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>. His health had by this time completely given way, and he
was likewise harassed by narrow means and hopeless love. He had,
however, the consolation of possessing many warm friends, by some
of whom, the Hunts and the Brawnes, he was tenderly nursed. At
last in 1821 he set out, accompanied by his friend Severn, on that
journey to Italy from which he never returned. After much suffering
he <i>d.</i> at Rome, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery there.
The character of K. was much misunderstood until the publication by
R.M. Milnes, afterwards <a href='#HOUGHTON_RICHARD_MONCKTON_MILNES_1ST_LORD_1809_1885'>Lord Houghton</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), of his <i>Life and Letters</i>,
which gives an attractive picture of him. This, together with the
accounts of other friends, represent him as &quot;eager, enthusiastic,
and sensitive, but humorous, reasonable, and free from vanity,
affectionate, a good brother and friend, sweet-tempered, and helpful.&quot;
In his political views he was liberal, in his religious, indefinite.
Though in his life-time subjected to much harsh and unappreciative
criticism, his place among English poets is now assured. His chief
characteristics are intense, sensuous imagination, and love of beauty,
rich and picturesque descriptive power, and exquisitely melodious
versification.</p>

&mdash;Poet and divine, <i>s.</i> of the
Rev. John K., Vicar of Coln St. Aldwyn's, Gloucestershire, <i>b.</i> at
Fairford in the same county, <i>ed.</i> by his <i>f.</i> and at Oxf., where he
<a name='Page_220'></a>was elected a Fellow of Oriel Coll., and was for some years tutor and
examiner in the Univ. His ideal life, however, was that of a country
clergyman, and having taken orders in 1815, he became curate
to his <i>f.</i> Meantime he had been writing <i>The Christian Year</i>, which
appeared in 1827, and met with an almost unparalleled acceptance.
Though at first anonymous, its authorship soon became known, with
the result that K. was in 1831 appointed to the Chair of Poetry at
Oxf., which he held until 1841. In 1833 his famous sermon on
&quot;national apostasy&quot; gave the first impulse to the Oxf. movement,
of which, after the secession of Newman to the Church of Rome, he,
along with Pusey, was regarded as the leader, and in connection
with which he contributed several of the more important &quot;tracts&quot;
in which were enforced &quot;deep submission to authority, implicit
reverence for Catholic tradition, firm belief in the divine prerogatives
of the priesthood, the real nature of the sacraments, and the danger of
independent speculation.&quot; His <i>f.</i> having <i>d.</i>, K. became in 1836 Vicar
of Hursley, near Winchester, where he remained until his death. In
1846 he <i>pub.</i> another book of poems, <i>Lyra Innocentium</i>. Other
works were a Life of Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man, and an ed. of
the Works of Hooker. After his death appeared <i>Letters of Spiritual
Counsel</i>, and 12 vols. of <i>Parish Sermons</i>. The literary position of K.
must mainly rest upon <i>The Christian Year</i>, <i>Thoughts in Verse for the
Sundays</i>, and <i>Holidays throughout the Year</i>, the object of which was,
as described by the author, to bring the thoughts and feelings of the
reader into unison with those exemplified in the Prayer Book. The
poems, while by no means of equal literary merit, are generally
characterised by delicate and true poetic feeling, and refined and
often extremely felicitous language; and it is a proof of the fidelity to
nature with which its themes are treated that the book has become
a religious classic with readers far removed from the author's ecclesiastical
standpoint and general school of thought. K. was one of
the most saintly and unselfish men who ever adorned the Church of
England, and, though personally shy and retiring, exercised a vast
spiritual influence upon his generation.</p>

<i>False Delicacy</i> (1768), had an extraordinary success, and was translated
into French, German, and Portuguese. His other plays had

order to devote himself to literature and public life. His first
literary venture had been <i>Eothen</i>, a brilliant and original work of
Eastern travel, <i>pub.</i> in 1844; but his <i>magnum opus</i> was his <i>Invasion
of the Crimea</i>, in 8 vols. (1863-87), which is one of the most effective
works of its class. It has, however, been charged with being too

<a name='KINGSLEY_CHARLES_1819_1875'></a><p><b>KINGSLEY, CHARLES (1819-1875).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and historian,
<i>s.</i> of a clergyman, was <i>b.</i> at Holne Vicarage near Dartmoor,
but passed most of his childhood at Barnack in the Fen country, and
Clovelly in Devonshire, <i>ed.</i> at King's Coll., London, and Camb. Intended
for the law, he entered the Church, and became, in 1842,
curate, and two years later rector, of Eversley, Hampshire. In the
latter year he <i>pub.</i> <i>The Saints' Tragedy</i>, a drama, of which the heroine
is St. Elizabeth of Hungary. Two novels followed, <i>Yeast</i> (1848) and
<i>Alton Locke</i> (1850), in which he deals with social questions as affecting
the agricultural labouring class, and the town worker respectively.
He had become deeply interested in such questions, and
threw himself heart and soul, in conjunction with F.D. Maurice and
others, into the schemes of social amelioration, which they supported
under the name of Christian socialism, contributing many
tracts and articles under the signature of &quot;Parson Lot.&quot; In 1853
appeared <i>Hypatia</i>, in which the conflict of the early Christians with
the Greek philosophy of Alexandria is depicted; it was followed in
1855 by <i>Westward Ho</i>, perhaps his most popular work; in 1857 by
<i>Two Years Ago</i>, and in 1866 by <i>Hereward the Wake</i>. <i>At Last</i> (1870),
gave his impressions of a visit to the West Indies. His taste for
natural history found expression in <i>Glaucus, or the Wonders of the
Shore</i> (1855), and other works. <i>The Water Babies</i> is a story for
children written to inspire love and reverence of Nature. K. was in
1860 appointed to the Professorship of Modern History at Camb.,
which he held until 1869. The literary fruit of this was <i>Roman and
Teuton</i> (1864). In the same year he was involved in a controversy
with J.H. Newman, which resulted in the publication by the latter
of his <i>Apologia</i>. K., who had in 1869 been made a Canon of Chester,
became Canon of Westminster in 1873. Always of a highly nervous
temperament, his over-exertion resulted in repeated failures of
health, and he <i>d.</i> in 1875. Though hot-tempered and combative, he
was a man of singularly noble character. His type of religion,
cheerful and robust, was described as &quot;muscular Christianity.&quot;
Strenuous, eager, and keen in feeling, he was not either a profoundly
learned, or perhaps very impartial, historian, but all his writings are
marked by a bracing and manly atmosphere, intense sympathy, and
great descriptive power.</p><br />

without graduating, and betook himself to the Australian gold-diggings,
being afterwards in the mounted police. On his return in
1858 he devoted himself industriously to literature, and wrote a
number of novels of much more than average merit, including <i>Geoffrey<a name='Page_223'></a>
Hamlyn</i> (1859), <i>The Hillyars and the Burtons</i> (1865), <i>Ravenshoe</i> (1861),
and <i>Austin Elliot</i> (1863). Of these <i>Ravenshoe</i> is generally regarded as

<a name='KNOX_JOHN_1505_1572'></a><p><b>KNOX, JOHN (1505?-1572).</b>
&mdash;Reformer and historian, was
<i>b.</i> near Haddington, and <i>ed.</i> at the Grammar School there and at
Glasgow. He is believed to have had some connection with the
family of K. of Ranfurly in Renfrewshire. The year of his birth
was long believed to be 1505, but of late some writers have found
reason to hold that he was really <i>b.</i> some years later, 1510 or even
1513. At Glasgow he was the pupil of <a href='#MAIR_or_MAJOR_JOHN_1469_1550'>John Major</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and became
distinguished as a disputant. He is believed to have been ordained
a priest about 1530, after which he went to St. Andrews and taught.
About this time, however, there is a gap of 12 years or more, during
which almost nothing is known of his life. About 1545 he came
<a name='Page_225'></a>under the influence of George Wishart, who was burned as a heretic
at St. Andrews in the following year, and embraced the Reformation
principles, of which he became a champion on the Continent, in England,
and finally and especially in Scotland. He joined the reforming
party in St. Andrews in 1547, and was, much against his will, elected
their minister. The next year he was made prisoner, sent to France,
and condemned to the galleys, where he remained for nearly two years.
For the next five years he was in England, chiefly at Newcastle and
Berwick, where he was zealously engaged in propagating and defending
the reformed doctrines. On the accession of Mary in 1553
K. escaped to the Continent, where he remained&mdash;at Dieppe, Frankfort
on the Maine, and Geneva&mdash;until 1559. During this period, in
addition to his pastoral and ecclesiastical activities, he wrote
copiously, the best known of his works of that time being his <i>First
Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment [government] of Women</i>.
The first, it proved also the last, as he never produced the
other two which he promised or threatened. He finally returned to
Scotland in 1559, and was at once the chief actor and the chief
narrator of the crowded and pregnant events which culminated in
the abdication of Queen Mary and the establishment of Protestantism
in Scotland. As minister of the High Church of Edin. K.
was at the centre of events, which he probably did more to mould
than any other man. As Carlyle says, &quot;He is the one Scotchman to
whom, of all others, his country and the world owe a debt.&quot; Here,
after his long battle with principalities and powers, and spiritual
wickedness in high places, his triumphs, and disappointments, after
growing weakness and becoming &quot;weary of the world,&quot; he <i>d.</i> on
November 24, 1572. His place in literature he has by virtue of his
<i>Historie of the Reformation in Scotland</i>. It extends from
1558-67.
Its language is much more English than that spoken and written
in Scotland at the time. It is of the highest historical value,
and in style terse, vigorous, with flashes of a quiet, somewhat
saturnine humour, and of vivid description&mdash;the writing of a great
man of action dealing with the events in which he had been the leading
actor. His own figure and that of the Queen are those round
which the drama turns. The leading features of his character were
courage and intense earnestness. &quot;Here,&quot; said the Regent Morton,
&quot;lies a man who never feared the face of man.&quot; And with all his
sternness there was in him a vein of cordial friendliness and humour.
He has been accused of intolerance, and of harshness in his dealings
with the Queen. But as Carlyle has said, as regards the second
accusation, &quot;They are not so coarse, these speeches; they seem to
me about as fine as the circumstances would permit. It was unfortunately
not possible to be polite with the Queen of Scotland
unless one proved untrue to the nation.&quot;</p>

life of hardship so common with the dramatists of his time, was for
a short time imprisoned for &quot;treasonable and Atheistic views,&quot; and
made translations from the French and Italian. His drama, <i>The
Spanish Tragedy</i> (1594), had extraordinary popularity, and was
translated into Dutch and German. Some of the scenes are believed
to have been contributed by another hand, probably by Ben
Jonson. He also produced a play on the story of Hamlet, not now
in existence, and he may have written the first draft of <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>. Other plays which have been attributed to him
are <i>The First Part of Jeronimo</i> (1605), <i>Cornelia</i> (1594), <i>The Rare
Triumphs of Love and Fortune</i>, and <i>The Tragedye of Solyman and

<a name='LAMB_CHARLES_1775_1834'></a><p><b>LAMB, CHARLES (1775-1834).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and poet, was <i>b.</i>
in London, his <i>f.</i> being confidential clerk to Samuel Salt, one of the
benchers of the Inner Temple. After being at a school in the neighbourhood,
he was sent by the influence of Mr. Salt to Christ's
Hospital, where he remained from 1782-89, and where he formed
a lifelong friendship with Coleridge. He was then for a year or two
in the South Sea House, where his elder brother John was a clerk.
Thence he was in 1792 transferred to the India House, where he
remained until 1825, when he retired with a pension of two-thirds
of his salary. Mr. Salt <i>d.</i> in 1792, and the family, consisting of the
<i>f.</i>, mother, Charles, and his sister Mary, ten years his senior, lived
together in somewhat straitened circumstances. John, comparatively
well off, leaving them pretty much to their own resources.
In 1796 the tragedy of L.'s life occurred. His sister Mary, in a
sudden fit of insanity, killed her mother with a table-knife. Thenceforward,
giving up a marriage to which he was looking forward, he
devoted himself to the care of his unfortunate sister, who became,
except when separated from him by periods of aberration, his lifelong
and affectionate companion&mdash;the &quot;Cousin Bridget&quot; of his
essays. His first literary appearance was a contribution of four
sonnets to Coleridge's <i>Poems on Various Subjects</i> (1796). Two
years later he <i>pub.</i>, along with his friend Charles Lloyd, <i>Blank Verse</i>,
the little vol. including <i>The Old Familiar Faces</i>, and others of his
best known poems, and his romance, <i>Rosamund Gray</i>, followed in
the same year. He then turned to the drama, and produced <i>John
Woodvil</i>, a tragedy, and <i>Mr. H.</i>, a farce, both failures, for although
the first had some echo of the Elizabethan music, it had no dramatic
force. Meantime the brother and sister were leading a life clouded
by poverty and by the anxieties arising from the condition of the
latter, and they moved about from one lodging to another. L.'s
literary ventures so far had not yielded much either in money or
fame, but in 1807 he was asked by <a href='#GODWIN_WILLIAM_1756_1836'>W. Godwin</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) to assist him in
his &quot;Juvenile Library,&quot; and to this he, with the assistance of his
sister, contributed the now famous <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i>, Charles
doing the tragedies and Mary the comedies. In 1808 they wrote,
again for children, <i>The Adventures of Ulysses</i>, a version of the
<i>Odyssey, Mrs. Leicester's School</i>, and <i>Poetry for Children</i> (1809).
About the same time he was commissioned by Longman to ed.
selections from the Elizabethan dramatists. To the selections were
added criticisms, which at once brought him the reputation of
being one of the most subtle and penetrating critics who had ever
touched the subject. Three years later his extraordinary power in
this department was farther exhibited in a series of papers on
Hogarth and Shakespeare, which appeared in Hunt's <i>Reflector</i>. In
1818 his scattered contributions in prose and verse were <i>coll.</i> as <i>The
Works of Charles Lamb</i>, and the favour with which they were
received led to his being asked to contribute to the <i>London Magazine</i>
the essays on which his fame chiefly rests. The name &quot;Elia&quot;
under which they were written was that of a fellow-clerk in the
India House. They appeared from 1820-25. The first series was
printed in 1823, the second, <i>The Last Essays of Elia</i>, in 1833. In
1823 the L.'s had left London and taken a cottage at Islington, and
had practically adopted Emma Isola, a young orphan, whose
<a name='Page_228'></a>presence brightened their lives until her marriage in 1833 to E.
Moxon, the publisher. In 1825 L. retired, and lived at Enfield and
Edmonton. But his health was impaired, and his sister's attacks of
mental alienation were ever becoming more frequent and of longer
duration. During one of his walks he fell, slightly hurting his face.
The wound developed into erysipelas, and he <i>d.</i> on December 29,
1834. His sister survived until 1847.</p>

<p>The place of L. as an essayist and critic is the very highest. His
only rival in the former department is Addison, but in depth and
tenderness of feeling, and richness of fancy L. is the superior. In
the realms of criticism there can be no comparison between the two.
L. is here at once profound and subtle, and his work led as much as
any other influence to the revival of interest in and appreciation of
our older poetry. His own writings, which are self-revealing in a
quite unusual and always charming way, and the recollections of his
friends, have made the personality of Lamb more familiar to us than
any other in our literature, except that of Johnson. His weaknesses,
his oddities, his charm, his humour, his stutter, are all as familiar to
his readers as if they had known him, and the tragedy and noble
self-sacrifice of his life add a feeling of reverence for a character we
already love.</p>

<a name='LANDOR_WALTER_SAVAGE_1775_1864'></a><p><b>LANDOR, WALTER SAVAGE (1775-1864).</b>
&mdash;Poet and miscellaneous
author, <i>s.</i> of a physician, was <i>b.</i> at Ipsley Court, Warwick,
the property of his mother, and <i>ed.</i> at Rugby and Oxf., where he
earned the nickname of &quot;the mad Jacobin,&quot; and whence he was
rusticated. His whole long life thereafter was a series of quarrels,
extravagances, and escapades of various kinds, the result of
his violent prejudices, love of paradox, and ungovernable temper.
He quarrelled with his <i>f.</i>, his wife, most of his relations, and
nearly all his friends, ran through a large fortune, and ended
his days in Italy supported by a pension granted by his brothers.
Yet he was not devoid of strong affections and generosity. His
earliest publication was <i>Poems</i> (1795); <i>Gebir</i> (1798), an epic, had
<a name='Page_229'></a>little success, but won for him the friendship of Southey. In 1808 he
went to Spain to take part in the war against Napoleon, and saw
some service. His first work to attract attention was his powerful
tragedy of <i>Don Julian</i> (1811). About the same time he <i>m.</i> Miss
Julia Thuillier&mdash;mainly, as would appear, on account of her &quot;wonderful
golden hair&quot;&mdash;and purchased the estate of Llantony Abbey,
Monmouthshire, whence, after various quarrels with the local
authorities, he went to France. After a residence of a year there,
he went in 1815 to Italy, where he lived until 1818 at Como, which,
having insulted the authorities in a Latin poem, he had to leave.
At Florence, which was his residence for some years, he commenced
his famous <i>Imaginary Conversations</i>, of which the first two vols. appeared
1824, the third 1828, fourth and fifth 1829. Other works
were <i>The Examination of W. Shakespeare touching Deer-stealing</i>
(1834), <i>Pericles and Aspasia</i> (1836), <i>Pentameron</i> (1837), <i>Hellenics</i>
(1847), and <i>Poemata et Inscriptiones</i> (1847). He quarrelled
finally with his wife in 1835, and returned to England, which,
however, he had to leave in 1858 on account of an action
for libel arising out of a book, <i>Dry Sticks Fagoted</i>. He went to
Italy, where he remained, chiefly at Florence, until his death. L.
holds one of the highest places among the writers of English
prose. His thoughts are striking and brilliant, and his style rich
and dignified.</p>

Little can be gleaned as to his personal history, and
of that little part is contradictory. In a note of the 15th century
written on one MS. he is said to have been <i>b.</i> in Oxfordshire, the <i>s.</i>
of a freeman named Stacy de Rokayle, while Bale, writing in the
16th century, makes his name Robert (certainly an error), and says
<a name='Page_230'></a>he was <i>b.</i> at Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire. From his great poem,
<i>Piers the Plowman</i>, it is to be gathered that he was bred to the
Church, and was at one time an inmate of the monastery at Great
Malvern. He <i>m.</i>, however, and had a <i>dau.</i>, which, of course, precluded
him from going on to the priesthood. It has further been
inferred from his poem that his f., with the help of friends, sent him
to school, but that on the death of these friends the process of education
came to an end, and he went to London, living in a little house
in Cornhill and, as he says, not only <i>in</i> but <i>on</i> London, supporting
himself by singing <i>requiems</i> for the dead. &quot;The tools I labour
with ... [are] <i>Paternoster</i>, and my primer <i>Placebo</i>, and <i>Dirige</i>, and
my <i>Psalter</i>, and my seven Psalms.&quot; References to legal terms
suggest that he may have copied for lawyers. In later life he
appears to have lived in Cornwall with his wife and <i>dau.</i> Poor himself,
he was ever a sympathiser with the poor and oppressed. His
poem appears to have been the great interest of his life, and almost
to the end he was altering and adding to, without, however, improving
it. The full title of the poem is <i>The Vision of Piers Plowman</i>.
Three distinct versions of it exist, the first <i>c.</i> 1362, the second <i>c.</i> 1377,
and the third 1393 or 1398. It has been described as &quot;a vision of
Christ seen through the clouds of humanity.&quot; It is divided into
nine dreams, and is in the unrhymed, alliterative, first English
manner. In the allegory appear such personifications as Meed
(worldly success), Falsehood, Repentance, Hope, etc. Piers Plowman,
first introduced as the type of the poor and simple, becomes
gradually transformed into the Christ. Further on appear Do-well,
Do-bet, Do-best. In this poem, and its additions, L. was able to
express all that he had to say of the abuses of the time, and their
remedy. He himself stands out as a sad, earnest, and clear-sighted
onlooker in a time of oppression and unrest. It is thought that he
may have been the author of a poem, <i>Richard the Redeless</i>: if so he
was, at the time of writing, living in Bristol, and making a last remonstrance
to the misguided King, news of whose death may have
reached him while at the work, as it stops in the middle of a paragraph.
He is not much of an artist, being intent rather on delivering
his message than that it should be in a perfect dress. Prof.
Manley, in the <i>Cambridge History of English Literature</i>, advances the
theory that <i>The Vision</i> is not the work of one, but of several writers,
W.L. being therefore a dramatic, not a personal name. It is supported
on such grounds as differences in metre, diction, sentence
structure, and the diversity of view on social and ecclesiastic matters
expressed in different parts of the poem.</p><br />

&mdash;Miscellaneous writer, <i>s.</i>
of a lawyer of Huguenot descent, was <i>b.</i> at Macon, Georgia. He had
a varied career, having been successively soldier, shopman, teacher,
lawyer, musician, and prof. His first literary venture was a novel,
<i>Tiger Lilies</i> (1867). Thereafter he wrote mainly on literature, his
works including <i>The Science of English Verse</i> (1881), <i>The English
Novel</i> (1883), and <i>Shakespeare and his Forerunners</i> (1902); also
some poems which have been greatly admired, including &quot;Corn,&quot;
&quot;The Marshes of Glynn,&quot; and &quot;The Song of the Chattahoochee&quot;; ed.
of Froissart, and the Welsh <i>Mabinogion</i> for children. He worked
<a name='Page_231'></a>under the shadow of serious lung trouble, which eventually brought
about his death.</p><br />

<a name='LARDNER_DIONYSIUS_1793_1859'></a><p><b>LARDNER, DIONYSIUS (1793-1859).</b>
&mdash;Scientific writer, <i>s.</i>
of a solicitor in Dublin, and <i>b.</i> there, was intended for the law, but
having no taste for it, he entered Trinity Coll., Dublin, and took
orders, but devoted himself to literary and scientific pursuits, and
became a contributor to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and various Encyclop&aelig;dias.
In 1827 he was appointed Prof. of Natural Philosophy and
Astronomy in the Univ. of London (afterwards Univ. Coll.), and in
1829 began his great work, <i>The Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, which was
finished in 133 vols. 20 years later. In his literary undertakings,
which included various other schemes of somewhat similar character,
he was eminently successful, financially and otherwise. He lived
in Paris from 1845 until his death.</p><br />

<a name='LATIMER_HUGH_1485_1555'></a><p><b>LATIMER, HUGH (1485-1555).</b>
&mdash;Reformer and divine, <i>s.</i> of
a Leicestershire yeoman, went to Camb. in 1500, and became Fellow
of Clare Hall. Taking orders, he was at first a defender of the
ancient faith, but convinced by the arguments of Bilney, embraced
the reformed doctrines. He was called to appear before Wolsey,
but dismissed on subscribing certain articles. His opposition to the
Pope, and his support of the King's supremacy, brought him under
the notice of Henry, and he was appointed chaplain to Anne Boleyn,
and in 1535 Bishop of Worcester. For preaching in favour of the
reformed doctrines he was twice imprisoned in the Tower, 1539 and
1546, and on the former occasion resigned his bishopric, which he
declined to resume on the accession of Edward VI. On the accession
of Mary he was with Ridley, Bishop of London, thrown into
prison (1554), and on October 16, 1555, burned at Oxf. His words
of encouragement to his fellow-martyr are well known, &quot;Be of good
comfort, Master Ridley, and play the man; we shall this day light
such a candle by God's grace in England as I trust shall never be
put out.&quot; He holds his place in English literature by virtue of his
sermons&mdash;especially that on <i>The Ploughers</i>&mdash;which, like himself, are
outspoken, homely, and popular, with frequent touches of kindly
humour.</p><br />

<a name='LAUDER_SIR_THOMAS_DICK_1784_1848'></a><p><b>LAUDER, SIR THOMAS DICK (1784-1848).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and
miscellaneous writer, <i>s.</i> of a Scottish baronet, wrote two novels,
<i>Lochandhu</i> (1825), and <i>The Wolf of Badenoch</i> (1827), but is best
known for his <i>Account of the Great Floods in Morayshire in 1829</i>. He
also wrote <i>Legendary Tales of the Highlands</i>, and contributed to
scientific journals and magazines.</p><br />

<a name='LAW_WILLIAM_1686_1761'></a><p><b>LAW, WILLIAM (1686-1761).</b>
&mdash;Divine, <i>s.</i> of a grocer at
Kingscliffe, Northamptonshire, was <i>ed.</i> at Camb., and in 1727 became
tutor to the <i>f.</i> of Edward Gibbon, the historian. About 1728 he
<i>pub.</i> his best known book, <i>A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</i>, a
work which has had a profound influence upon the religious life of
England, largely owing to the impression which it produced upon
such minds as those of Dr. Johnson, the Wesleys, and others. In 1737
he became a student of the works of Jacob Boehmen, the German
mystic, and devoted himself largely to the exposition of his views.<a name='Page_232'></a>
The theological position of L. was a complicated one, combining
High Churchism, mysticism, and Puritanism: his writings are characterised
by vigorous thought, keen logic, and a lucid and brilliant
style, relieved by flashes of bright, and often sarcastic, humour. His
work attacking Mandeville's <i>Fable of the Bees</i> (1723) is perhaps that
in which these qualities are best displayed in combination. He
retired in 1740 to Kingscliffe, where he had founded a school for 14
girls.</p><br />

<a name='LAYAMON_fl_1200'></a><p><b>LAYAMON (<i>fl.</i> 1200).</b>
&mdash;Metrical historian, the <i>s.</i> of Leovenath.
All that is known of him is gathered from his own writings.
He was a priest at Ernley (now Areley Regis), Worcestershire. In
his day the works of Geoffrey of Monmouth and Wace, in French,
were the favourite reading of the educated, and &quot;it came to him in
mind&quot; that he would tell the story of <i>Brut</i> in English verse. He
set out in search of books and, founding his poem on the earlier
writers, he added so much from his own knowledge of Welsh and
West of England tradition that while Wace's poem consists of 15,000
lines, his extends to 32,000. Among the legends he gives are those
of <i>Locrine</i>, <i>Arthur</i>, and <i>Lear</i>. The poem is in the old English unrhymed,
alliterative verse, and &quot;marks the revival of the English
mind and spirit.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='LAYARD_SIR_AUSTIN_HENRY_1817_1894'></a><p><b>LAYARD, SIR AUSTIN HENRY (1817-1894).</b>
&mdash;Explorer of
Nineveh, <i>b.</i> at Paris, <i>s.</i> of a Ceylon civilian. After spending some
years in the office of a London solicitor, he set out in search of employment
in Ceylon, but passing through Western Asia, became interested
in the work of excavating the remains of ancient cities. Many of his
finds&mdash;human-headed bulls, etc.&mdash;were sent to the British Museum.
Two books&mdash;<i>Nineveh and its Remains</i> (1848-49), and <i>The Ruins of
Nineveh and Babylon</i> (1853)&mdash;brought him fame, and on his return
home he received many honours, including the freedom of the City
of London, the degree of D.C.L. from Oxf., and the Lord Rectorship
of Aberdeen Univ. He entered Parliament, where he sat as a
Liberal. He held the offices of Under-Foreign Sec. (1861-66), and
Chief Commissioner of Works (1868-69), and was Ambassador to
Spain 1869, and Constantinople 1877; and on his retirement in 1878
he was made G.C.B. He was a very successful excavator, and described
his work brilliantly, but he was no great linguist, and most
of the deciphering of the inscriptions was done by Sir H. Rawlinson.
His last work was <i>Early Adventures in Persia, etc.</i>, and he left an
autobiography, <i>pub.</i> in 1903. He also wrote on Italian art.</p><br />

<a name='LEAR_EDWARD_1812_1888'></a><p><b>LEAR, EDWARD (1812-1888).</b>
&mdash;Artist and miscellaneous
author, <i>b.</i> in London, and settled in Rome as a landscape painter.
He was an indefatigable traveller, and wrote accounts, finely illustrated,
of his journeys in Italy, Greece, and Corsica. His best
<a name='Page_233'></a>known works are, however, his <i>Book of Nonsense</i> (1840) (full of wit
and <i>good</i> sense), <i>More Nonsense Rhymes</i> (1871), and <i>Laughable
Lyrics</i> (1876). L. had also a remarkable faculty for depicting birds.</p><br />

<a name='LECKY_WILLIAM_EDWARD_HARTPOLE_1838_1903'></a><p><b>LECKY, WILLIAM EDWARD HARTPOLE (1838-1903).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
the <i>s.</i> of a landed gentleman of Carlow, was <i>b.</i> near Dublin,
and <i>ed.</i> at Cheltenham and Trinity Coll., Dublin. Originally intended
for the Church, he devoted himself to a literary career. His
first work of importance was <i>Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland</i>
(1861) (essays on Swift, Flood, Grattan, and O'Connell). The study
of Buckle's <i>History of Civilisation</i> to some extent determined the
direction of his own writings, and resulted in the production of two
important works, <i>History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of
Rationalism in Europe</i> (1865), and <i>History of European Morals from
Augustus to Charlemagne</i> (1869), both remarkable for learning,
clearness, and impartiality. Both, however, gave rise to considerable
controversy and criticism. His principal work is <i>The History
of England in the Eighteenth Century</i> (1878-90). Characterised by
the same sterling qualities as his preceding books, it deals with a
subject more generally interesting, and has had a wide acceptance.
His view of the American war, and the controversies which led to it,
is more favourable to the English position than that of some earlier
historians. Other works are <i>Democracy and Liberty</i> (1896), and <i>The
Map of Life</i> (1899). Though of warm Irish sympathies, L. was
strongly opposed to Home Rule. He sat in Parliament for his
Univ. from 1895 until his death. He received many academical distinctions,
and was a Corresponding Member of the Institute of
France, and one of the original members of the Order of Merit.</p><br />

<a name='LEE_NATHANIEL_1653_1692'></a><p><b>LEE, NATHANIEL (1653?-1692).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist, <i>s.</i> of a
clergyman at Hatfield, was <i>ed.</i> at Westminster School and Camb.
After leaving the Univ. he went to London, and joined the stage
both as actor and author. He was taken up by Rochester and others
of the same dissolute set, led a loose life, and drank himself into
Bedlam, where he spent four years. After his recovery he lived
mainly upon charity, and met his death from a fall under the effects
of a carouse. His tragedies, which, with much bombast and frequent
untrained flights of imagination, have occasional fire and
tenderness, are generally based on classical subjects. The principal
are <i>The Rival Queens</i>, <i>Theodosius</i>, and <i>Mithridates</i>. He also wrote
a few comedies, and collaborated with Dryden in an adaptation of
<i>&OElig;dipus</i>, and in <i>The Duke of Guise</i>.</p><br />

&mdash;Novelists
and dramatists, <i>dau.</i> of John L., an actor, were the
authors of various dramatic pieces and novels. By far their most
memorable work was <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, 5 vols. (1797-1805)
which, with the exception of two, <i>The Young Lady's</i> and <i>The Clergyman's</i>,
were all by Harriet. The most powerful of them, <i>Kruitzner</i>,
fell into the hands of Byron in his boyhood, and made so profound
an impression upon him that, in 1821, he dramatised it under the
title of <i>Werner, or the Inheritance</i>. The authoress also adapted it for
the stage as <i>The Three Strangers</i>. The tales are in general remarkable
for the ingenuity of their plots. Harriet lived to the age of 94,
<a name='Page_234'></a>preserving to the last her vigour of mind and powers of conversation.
Godwin made her an offer of marriage to which, however, his
religious opinions presented an insuperable barrier. Sophia's chief
work was <i>The Chapter of Accidents</i>, a comedy, which had a great run,
the profits of which enabled the sisters to start a school at Bath,
which proved very successful, and produced for them a competence
on which they were able to retire in their later years.</p><br />

<a name='LE_FANU_JOSEPH_SHERIDAN_1814_1873'></a><p><b>LE FANU, JOSEPH SHERIDAN (1814-1873).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>s.</i>
of a Dean of the Episcopal Church of Ireland, and grand-nephew of
Richard Brinsley Sheridan, was <i>ed.</i> at Trinity Coll., Dublin, and became
a contributor and ultimately proprietor of the <i>Dublin University
Magazine</i>, in which many of his novels made their first appearance.
Called to the Bar in 1839, he did not practise, and was first brought
into notice by two ballads, <i>Phaudrig Croohoore</i> and <i>Shamus
O'Brien</i>, which had extraordinary popularity. His novels, of
which he wrote 12, include <i>The Cock and Anchor</i> (1845), <i>Torlough
O'Brien</i> (1847), <i>The House by the Churchyard</i> (1863), <i>Uncle Silas</i>
(perhaps the most popular) (1864), <i>The Tenants of Malory</i> (1867), <i>In
a Glass Darkly</i> (1872), and <i>Willing to Die</i> (posthumously). They
are generally distinguished by able construction, ingenuity of plot,
and power in the presentation of the mysterious and supernatural.
Among Irish novelists he is generally ranked next to Lever.</p><br />

<a name='LEIGHTON_ROBERT_1611_1684'></a><p><b>LEIGHTON, ROBERT (1611-1684).</b>
&mdash;Divine, was the <i>s.</i> of
Alexander L., physician, and writer on theology, who, on account
of his anti-prelatic books, was put in the pillory, fined, and had his
nose slit and his ears cut off. Robert was <i>ed.</i> at Edin., after which
he resided for some time at Douay. Returning to Scotland he
received Presbyterian ordination, and was admitted minister of
Newbattle, near Edin. In 1653 he was appointed Principal and
Prof. of Divinity in the Univ. of Edin., which offices he held until
1662 when, having separated himself from Presbyterianism, he was
appointed Bishop of Dunblane, under the new Episcopal establishment.
He repeatedly but unsuccessfully endeavoured to bring
about an ecclesiastical union in Scotland on the basis of combining
the best elements in each system. Discouraged by his lack of success
in his well-meant efforts, he offered in 1665 to resign his see, but was
persuaded by Charles II. to remain in it, and in 1669 was promoted
to be Archbishop of Glasgow, from which position, wearied and disappointed,
he finally retired in 1674, and lived with his widowed
sister, Mrs. Lightmaker, at Broadhurst Manor, Sussex. On a visit
to London he was seized with a fatal illness, and <i>d.</i> in the arms of his
friend, Bishop Burnet, who says of him, &quot;he had the greatest elevation
of soul, the largest compass of knowledge, the most mortified
and heavenly disposition that I ever saw in mortal.&quot; His sermons
and commentaries, all <i>pub.</i> posthumously, maintain a high place
among English religious classics, alike for thought and style. They
consist of his <i>Commentary on St. Peter</i>, <i>Sermons</i>, and <i>Spiritual Exercises,
Letters, etc.</i> His <i>Lectures and Addresses</i> in Latin were also <i>pub.</i></p><br />

In his travels he made a study of the gipsies, on whom he wrote more
<a name='Page_235'></a>than one book. His fame rests chiefly on his <i>Hans Breitmann
Ballads</i> (1871), written in the <i>patois</i> known as Pennsylvania Dutch.
Other books of his are <i>Meister Karl's Sketch-book</i> (1855), <i>Legends of

Paris. He was a good linguist, and one of the first Englishmen to
acquire Greek, and he was likewise acquainted with French, Italian,
Spanish, Welsh, and Anglo-Saxon. He became chaplain and librarian
to Henry VIII., from whom he received the Rectory of Poppeling,
near Calais, and in 1533 the appointment of King's Antiquary.
Soon afterwards he was permitted to do his work in France by
deputy, and was commissioned to go over England in search of
documents and antiquities; and on the strength of this made his
famous tour, which lasted for about six years. He was able to do
something to stem the destruction of manuscripts on the dissolution
of the monasteries, and made vast collections of documents and
information regarding the monuments and general features of the
country, which, however, he was unable fully to digest and set in
order. They formed, nevertheless, an almost inexhaustible quarry
in which succeeding workers in the same field, such as Stow, Camden,
and Dugdale, wrought. In his last years he was insane, and hence
none of his collections appeared in his lifetime. His <i>Itinerary</i> was,
however, at length <i>pub.</i> by T. Hearne in 9 vols. (1710-12), and his
<i>Collectanea</i> in 6 vols. (1715).</p><br />

1562, Prof. of Canon Law. He was a Privy Councillor 1565, and
Bishop of Ross 1566, and was the confidential friend of Queen Mary,
who made him her ambassador to Queen Elizabeth. He was thrown
into the Tower for his share in promoting a marriage between Mary
and the Duke of Norfolk, whence being released on condition of
leaving England, he went first to Paris and then to Rome, where he
busied himself on behalf of his mistress. He became Vicar-General of
the diocese of Rouen in 1579, and <i>d.</i> at the monastery of Guirtenburg
near Brussels. While in England he wrote in Scots vernacular his<a name='Page_236'></a>
<i>History of Scotland</i> from the death of James I. (where Boece left off)

Camb., and in 1638 took arms for the King. Six years later he was
captured, imprisoned in Newgate, and condemned to death. He,
however, escaped, endeavoured to make a rising in Kent, and had to
flee to Holland, where he was employed in the service of Charles II.
On receiving a pardon from Cromwell he returned to England in
1653. In view of the Restoration he was active in writing on
behalf of monarchy, and in 1663 <i>pub.</i> <i>Considerations and Proposals
in order to Regulating of the Press</i>, for which he was appointed Surveyor
of Printing-Presses and Licenser of the Press, and received a
grant of the sole privilege of printing public news. His first newspaper,
<i>The Intelligencer</i>, appeared in the same year, and was followed
by <i>The News</i> and the <i>City Mercury, or Advertisements concerning
Trade</i>. Thereafter his life was spent in ed. newspapers and writing
political pamphlets in support of the Court and against the Whigs
and Dissenters. In 1685 he was knighted. His controversies repeatedly
got him into trouble, and after the Revolution he lost his
appointments, and was more than once imprisoned. In addition to
his political writings he translated <i>&AElig;sop's Fables</i>, Seneca's <i>Morals</i>,
and Cicero's <i>Offices</i>. His <i>&AElig;sop</i> contains much from other authors,
including himself. In his writings he was lively and vigorous but
coarse and abusive.</p><br />

&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i> at
Dublin, and <i>ed.</i> at Trinity Coll. there. He studied medicine at
G&ouml;ttingen, and practised at various places in Ireland. In 1837 he
contributed to the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i> his first novel, <i>Harry

decided him to devote himself to literature. He accordingly
followed it with <i>Charles O'Malley</i> (1840), his most popular book.

his light-hearted, breezy, rollicking stories, among which may be
mentioned <i>Jack Hinton</i> (1842), <i>Tom Burke of Ours</i>, <i>Arthur O'Leary</i>,
and <i>The Dodd Family Abroad</i>. <i>The O'Donoghue</i> and <i>The Knight of
Gwynne</i> (1847) are more in the nature of historical romances. In
1864 he contributed to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> a series of miscellaneous
papers, <i>Cornelius O'Dowd on Men, Women, and Things in
General</i>. L.'s life was largely spent abroad. After practising his
profession in Brussels 1840-42 he returned to Dublin to ed. the

Thereafter he ed. the <i>Leader</i> (1851-54), and the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>
(which he founded) (1865-66). His articles deal with an extraordinary

Sciences</i> (1853), <i>The Psychology of Common Life</i> (1859), <i>Studies in
Animal Life</i> (1862), <i>Problems of Life and Mind</i> (1873-79). L. was
an exceptionally able dramatic critic, and in this department he
produced <i>Actors and the Art of Acting</i> (1875), and a book on the
Spanish Drama. By far his greatest work, however, is his <i>Life and
Works of Goethe</i> (1855), which remains the standard English work on
the subject, and which by the end of the century had, in its German
translation, passed into 16 ed. He also wrote two novels, <i>Ranthorpe</i>
(1847), and <i>Rose, Blanche, and Violet</i> (1848), neither of which
attained any success. In his writings he is frequently brilliant and
original; but his education and training, whether in philosophy or
biology, were not sufficiently thorough to give him a place as a
master in either. L.'s life was in its latter section influenced by
his irregular connection with Miss Evans (&quot;George Eliot&quot;), with
whom he lived for the last 24 years of it, in close intellectual sympathy.
To his appreciation and encouragement were largely due
her taking up prose fiction.</p><br />

<a name='LEWIS_SIR_GEORGE_CORNEWALL_1806_1863'></a><p><b>LEWIS, SIR GEORGE CORNEWALL (1806-1863).</b>
&mdash;Scholar
and statesman, <i>s.</i> of Sir Thomas F.L., a Radnorshire baronet, was
<i>ed.</i> at Eton and Oxf. He studied law, was called to the Bar in 1831,
and entered Parliament in 1847, where his intellect and character
soon gained him great influence. After serving on various important
commissions and holding minor offices, he became Chancellor of
the Exchequer 1855-58, Home Sec. 1859-61, and War Sec. 1861-63.
His official labours did not prevent his entering into profound and
laborious studies, chiefly in regard to Roman history, and the state
of knowledge among the ancients. In his <i>Inquiry into the Credibility
of Ancient Roman History</i> (1855), he combated the methods
and results of Niebuhr. Other works are <i>On the Use and Abuse of
Political Terms</i>, <i>Authority in Matters of Opinion</i>, <i>The Astronomy of
the Ancients</i>, and a <i>Dialogue on the best Form of Government</i>. The
somewhat sceptical turn of his mind led him to sift evidence minutely,
and the labour involved in his wide range of severe study and his
public duties no doubt shortened his valuable life.</p><br />

<a name='LEWIS_MATTHEW_GREGORY_1775_1818'></a><p><b>LEWIS, MATTHEW GREGORY (1775-1818).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>s.</i> of
Matthew L., Deputy Sec. in the War Office, was <i>ed.</i> at Westminster
and Oxf. Thereafter he went to Germany. From his childhood
tales of witchcraft and the supernatural had a powerful fascination
for him, and in Germany he had ample opportunities for pursuing
his favourite study, with the result that at the age of 20 he became
the author of <i>The Monk</i>, a tale in which the supernatural and the
<a name='Page_238'></a>horrible predominate to an unprecedented extent, and from which
he is known as &quot;Monk L.&quot; The same characteristic appears in all
his works, among which may be mentioned <i>Tales of Terror</i> (1779),
<i>Tales of Wonder</i> (to which Sir W. Scott contributed), and <i>Romantic
Tales</i> (1808). Though affected and extravagant in his manners, L.
was not wanting in kindly and generous feelings, and in fact an illness
contracted on a voyage to the West Indies to inquire into and
remedy some grievances of the slaves on his estates there was the
cause of his death.</p><br />

<a name='LEYDEN_JOHN_1775_1811'></a><p><b>LEYDEN, JOHN (1775-1811).</b>
&mdash;Poet and Orientalist, <i>b.</i> at
Denholm, Roxburghshire, gave early evidence of superior ability,
and his <i>f.</i>, who was a shepherd, destined him for the Church. He
accordingly entered the Univ. of Edin., where he had a brilliant
career, showing a special aptitude for languages and natural history.
In 1800 he became a licentiate of the Church, but continued his
scientific and linguistic studies, and also began to write. In 1799 he
had <i>pub.</i> a sketch of the <i>Discoveries and Settlements of the Europeans
in Northern and Western Africa</i>, and he contributed to Scott's <i>Minstrelsy
of the Scottish Border</i>, and to &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis's <i>Tales of
Wonder</i>. His enthusiasm for Oriental learning led to application
being made on his behalf to Government for some situation which
would make his acquirements available for the public service, but
the only opening which could be obtained was that of a ship's
surgeon. By extraordinary exertions L. qualified himself for this
in a few months, and set sail for the East, after finishing his poem,
<i>Scenes of Infancy</i>. Soon after his arrival at Madras his health gave
way, and after some time passed in Prince of Wales Island he visited
the Malay Peninsula, and some of the East Indian Islands, collecting
vast stores of linguistic and ethnographical information, on which
was founded his great <i>Dissertation on the Indo-Persian, Indo-Chinese,
and Dekkan Languages</i> (1807). Soon after this L. was appointed a
prof. in the Bengal Coll., and a little later a judge in Calcutta. In
1811 he accompanied the Governor-General, Lord Minto, to Java.
His health, however, had been undermined by his almost super-human
exertions, and immediately after landing he contracted
a fever, of which he <i>d.</i> in three days at the early age of 36. Two
Oriental works translated by him, <i>Sej&acirc;rah Mal&acirc;yu</i> (Malay Annals)
and <i>Commentaries of Baber</i> were <i>pub.</i> respectively in 1821 and 1826.</p><br />

Bampton Lectures on <i>The Divinity of Our Lord</i>, and came to be
recognised as one of the ablest and most eloquent representatives of
<a name='Page_239'></a>the High Church party. His sermons in St. Paul's were among the

&mdash;Scottish
poet and satirist, <i>s.</i> of David L. of Garmylton, near Haddington,
was <i>b.</i> either there or at The Mount in Fife, and <i>ed.</i> at St. Andrews.
Early in life he was at the Court of James IV., and on the King's
death was appointed to attend on the infant James V., whose friend
and counsellor he remained, though his advice was, unhappily for
his country, not always given heed to. In 1529 he was knighted and
made Lyon King at Arms. He was employed on various missions to
the Emperor Charles V., and to Denmark, France, and England.
He was always in sympathy with the people as against the nobles
and the clergy, and was their poet, with his words in their mouths.
He favoured the Reformers, and was one of those who urged Knox
to become a preacher. He did not, however, adhere to the reformed
congregation, and <i>d.</i> at least nominally in the Roman Church. Yet
he lashed the vices of the clergy as they had never been lashed before,
and only escaped their vengeance by the protection of the King, who
also condoned the severities directed against himself. His latter
days were spent at The Mount, where he <i>d.</i> His chief writings are
<i>The Dreme</i>, written 1528, <i>The Complaynt to the King</i> (1529), <i>The

(1530), <i>Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Three Estaitis</i>, <i>A Dialogue betwixt
Experience and a Courtier</i> (1552), <i>The Monarchy</i> (1554), and <i>The
History of Squyer Meldrum</i>. L. was a true poet, gifted with fancy,
humour, and a powerful satiric touch and a love of truth and
justice. He had a strong influence in turning the minds of the
common people in favour of the Reformation.</p>

Laird or tenant of Pitscottie, Fife, wrote a history entitled

<a name='LINGARD_JOHN_1771_1851'></a><p><b>LINGARD, JOHN (1771-1851).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>b.</i> at Winchester
of humble Roman Catholic parentage, was in 1782 sent to
the English Coll. at Douay, whence he escaped from the revolutionaries
in 1793, and returning to England, went to Crookhall Coll.,
near Durham, and afterwards to Ushaw. Ordained a priest in 1795,
he became Vice-Pres. and Prof. of Philosophy at the latter coll. In
1806 he <i>pub.</i> <i>The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</i>, and while a
missioner at Hornby, Lancashire, began his <i>History of England to
the Accession of William and Mary</i> (8 vols., 1819-30). In the preparation
of this work L. had access to material hitherto <i>unpub.</i>, and
not available for Protestant historians, such as documents in the
Vatican and other Roman Catholic sources, and was consequently
able to throw new light on various parts of his subject. The work
was attacked by various writers from the Protestant standpoint. L.
replied to his critics with the result that it is now generally admitted
that the history, while in parts coloured by the theological and
political point of view of the author, is generally an impartial and
valuable work, and it remains a leading authority on the Reformation
period viewed from the side of the enlightened Roman Catholic
priesthood. This opinion is supported by the fact that the Ultramontane
party among the Roman Catholics regarded the book as a
dangerous one in respect of the interests of their Church.</p><br />

operative in a cotton mill there. Becoming interested in foreign
missions he qualified himself, and entering the service of the London
Missionary Society, set out in 1846 to South Africa. He subsequently
made journeys into the interior, which ultimately developed
into his great pioneering and exploration expeditions, in which he
discovered Lake Ngami 1849, and the river Zambesi 1851. In 1856
he visited England, <i>pub.</i> his <i>Missionary Travels</i> (1857), and retired
from the service of the London Missionary Society. He was Consul
at Quilimane 1858-64, and in 1858 commanded an expedition for
exploring Eastern and Central Africa, in the course of which he discovered
Lakes Shirwa and Nyassa 1859. Again visiting England
he <i>pub.</i> his second book, <i>The Zambesi and its Tributaries</i> (1865).
Returning to Africa he organised an expedition to the Nile basin,
discovered Lake Bangweolo, explored the cannibal country, enduring
terrible sufferings and dangers, from which he was rescued just
in time by H.M. Stanley. His last journey was to discover the
sources of the Nile, but it proved fatal, as he <i>d.</i> at a village in Ilala.
His remains were brought home and buried in Westminster Abbey.
L. was a man of indomitable courage, and of a simple nobility of
character. His writings are plain, unadorned statements of his work
and experiences. He ranks among the greatest explorers and philanthropists.
The diary which he kept was <i>pub.</i> as <i>Last Journals of
David Livingstone in Central Africa</i> (1874). His view of his duty
in the circumstances in which he found himself was to be a pioneer
opening up new ground, and leaving native agents to work it up.</p><br />

<a name='LOCKE_JOHN_1632_1704'></a><p><b>LOCKE, JOHN (1632-1704).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher, <i>s.</i> of a landsteward,
was <i>b.</i> at Wrington, near Bristol, and <i>ed.</i> at Westminster
School and Oxf. In 1660 he became lecturer on Greek, in 1662 on
Rhetoric, and in 1664 he went as sec. to an Embassy to Brandenburg.
While a student he had turned from the subtleties of Aristotle
and the schoolmen, had studied Descartes and Bacon, and
becoming attracted to experimental science, studied medicine, and
practised a little in Oxf. At the same time his mind had been much
exercised by questions of morals and government, and in 1667 he
<a name='Page_242'></a>wrote his <i>Essay on Toleration</i>. In the same year he became known
to Lord Ashley (afterwards 1st Earl of Shaftesbury), in whose house
he went to reside. Here he made the acquaintance of Buckingham,
Halifax, and other leading men of the time, and was entrusted by
Ashley with the education of his <i>s.</i>, and afterwards of his grandson,
the famous <a href='#SHAFTESBURY_ANTHONY_ASHLEY_COOPER_3RD_EARL_OF_1671_1713'>3rd Earl of Shaftesbury</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). He was also employed by
him to draw up a constitution for the new colony of Carolina, the
provisions of which in regard to religion were regarded as too liberal
and were, at the instance of the Established Church, departed from.
In 1672 when Ashley became Chancellor he bestowed upon L. the
office of Sec. of Presentations, and afterwards a post at the Board of
Trade. In 1675 L. graduated M.B., and in the same year went for
the benefit of his health, which had always been delicate, to Montpelier,
where there was then a celebrated medical school, and subsequently
to Paris, where he became acquainted with most of the
eminent Frenchmen of the day. Recalled by Shaftesbury in 1679
he returned to England but, his patron having in 1682 been obliged
to take refuge in Holland from a prosecution for high treason, he
followed him there. In consequence of this he became obnoxious
to the Government, and was in 1684 deprived of his studentship at
Christ Church. Shaftesbury having <i>d.</i> in Holland, L. remained
there until the Revolution, when he returned to England in the fleet
which carried the Princess of Orange. He was now in favour with
Government, and had the offer of diplomatic employment which,
on account of his health, he declined, but was appointed a Commissioner
of Appeals. In 1698 he was an adviser of the Government
on the question of the coinage, and was made a member of the newly
instituted Council on Trade, which position he resigned in 1700.
During his last years he lived with Sir Francis and Lady Masham at
Gates in Essex, where Lady M., who was a <i>dau.</i> of <a href='#CUDWORTH_RALPH_1617_1688'>Ralph Cudworth</a>
(<i>q.v.</i>), and an old friend, assiduously tended his last years. The
services of L. to his country in civil and religious matters were
various and great; but it is upon his philosophical writings, and
chiefly on his <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i> (1690) that
his fame rests. It is divided into four books, of which the first
treats of innate ideas (the existence of which he denies), the second
traces the origin of ideas, the third deals with language, and the
fourth lays down the limits of the understanding. Other works
of his are <i>Thoughts concerning Education</i> (1693), <i>On the Conduct of
the Understanding</i> (<i>pub.</i> posthumously), <i>The Reasonableness of Christianity</i>
(1695), <i>Treatise on Government</i>, and <i>Letters on Toleration</i>. If
not a very profound or original philosopher L. was a calm, sensible,
and reasonable writer, and his books were very influential on the
English thought of his day, as well as on the French philosophy
of the next century. His style is plain and clear, but lacking in
brightness and variety.</p>

in 1816, but had little taste for the profession. Having, however,
already tried literature (he had translated Schlegel's <i>Lectures on the
History of Literature</i>), he devoted himself more and more to a literary
life. He joined John Wilson, and became one of the leading contributors
to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>. After bringing out <i>Peter's Letters
to his Kinsfolk</i> (1819), sketches mainly of Edinburgh society, he
produced four novels, <i>Valerius</i> (1821), <i>Adam Blair</i> (1822), <i>Reginald
Dalton</i> (1824), and <i>Matthew Wald</i> (1824). His <i>Life of Burns</i> appeared
in 1828. He was ed. of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> 1824-53. In
1820 he had <i>m.</i> Sophia, <i>dau.</i> of Sir Walter Scott, which led to a close
friendship with the latter, and to his writing his famous <i>Life of Scott</i>,
undoubtedly one of the greatest biographies in the language. His
later years were overshadowed with deep depression caused by the
death of his wife and children. A singularly reserved and cold
manner led to his being regarded with dislike by many, but his
intimate friends were warmly attached to him.</p><br />

Taylor's School and Oxf. He was a student of Lincoln's Inn, but
abandoned law for literature, ultimately studied medicine, and
took M.D. at Oxf. 1603; having become a Roman Catholic, he had
a large practice, chiefly among his co-religionists. In 1580 he <i>pub.
A Defence of Plays</i> in reply to Gosson's <i>School of Abuse</i>; and he
wrote poems, dramas, and romances. His principal dramatic
works are <i>The Wounds of Civil War</i>, and (in conjunction with
<a href='#GREENE_ROBERT_1560_1592'>Greene</a>, <i>q.v.</i>) <i>A Looking-glass for London and England</i>. Among
his romances may be mentioned <i>Euphues' Shadow</i>, <i>Forbonius and
Prisceria</i> (1584), and <i>Rosalynde, Euphues' Golden Legacie</i> (1590).
His poems include <i>Glaucus and Scilia</i> (1589), <i>Phillis honoured
with Pastoral Sonnets, Elegies, and Amorous Delights</i> (1593). <i>Rosalynde</i>,
his best known work, and the source from which Shakespeare
is said to have drawn <i>As you like It</i>, was written to beguile the tedium
of a voyage to the Canaries. <i>Robin the Divell</i> and <i>William Longbeard</i>
are historical romances. L. was also a voluminous translator.
He was one of the founders of the regular English drama, but his own
plays are heavy and tedious. His romances, popular in their day, are sentimental
and over-refined in language, but are enlivened by lyrical
pieces in which he is far more successful than in his dramatic work.</p><br />

still unsettled, as to the authorship of certain of the pieces

poets the disputed authorship extends to the gem of the collection,
the exquisite <i>Ode to the Cuckoo</i>, beginning &quot;Hail, beauteous stranger

Charlottesville, 1824-28, of Greek at University Coll., London,
1828-31, and of Latin there, 1842-46. He did much for the diffusion
of education, was one of the founders and sec. of the Royal Geographical
Society, and ed. of the <i>Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>. He translated
Marcus Aurelius (1862), and <i>The Discourses of Epictetus</i> (1877), and

<a name='LONGFELLOW_HENRY_WADSWORTH_1807_1882'></a><p><b>LONGFELLOW, HENRY WADSWORTH (1807-1882).</b>
&mdash;Poet,
was <i>b.</i> at Portland, Maine, the <i>s.</i> of Stephen L., a lawyer. From
childhood he cared little for games, but was always devoted to reading.
In 1822 he was sent to Bowdoin Coll., of which his <i>f.</i> was a
Trustee, and after graduating was appointed to a new Chair of
Modern Languages, which the coll. had decided to establish, and
with the view of more completely qualifying him for his duties, he
was sent to Europe for a three years' course of study. He accordingly
went to France, Spain, and Italy. Returning in 1829 he commenced
his professional duties, writing also in the <i>North American
Review</i>. In 1831 he entered into his first marriage, and in 1833 he
<i>pub.</i> his first books, a translation from the Spanish, followed by the
first part of <i>Outre Mer</i>, an account of his travels. At the end of the
year L. was invited to become Prof. of Modern Languages at Harvard,
an offer which he gladly accepted. He paid a second visit to
Europe accompanied by his wife, who, however, <i>d.</i> at Amsterdam.
He returned to his duties in 1836, and in 1838 appeared <i>Voices
of the Night</i>, containing the &quot;Psalm of Life&quot; and &quot;Excelsior,&quot;
which had extraordinary popularity, and gave him a place in the
affections of his countrymen which he held until his death. The
same year saw the publication of <i>Hyperion</i>. His next work was
<i>Ballads and other Poems</i>, containing &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot;
and &quot;The Village Blacksmith.&quot; In 1843 he <i>m.</i> his second wife,
and in the same year appeared <i>The Spanish Student</i>, a drama.
The <i>Belfry of Bruges</i> and <i>Evangeline</i> (1847), generally considered
his masterpiece, followed. In 1849 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Kavanagh</i>, a novel
which added nothing to his reputation, and in 1851 <i>Seaside and
Fireside</i>, and <i>The Golden Legend</i>. Having now a sufficient and
secure income from his writings, he resigned his professorship, and
devoted himself entirely to literature. <i>Hiawatha</i> appeared in 1855,
and <i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i> in 1858. In 1861 he lost his
wife under tragic circumstances, a blow which told heavily upon
<a name='Page_245'></a>him. His latest works were a translation of Dante's <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
<i>Tales of a Wayside Inn</i>, <i>The New England Tragedies</i>, and
<i>The Divine Tragedy</i>, the last two of which he combined with <i>The
Golden Legend</i> into a trilogy, which he named <i>Christus</i>. In 1868
he paid a last visit to England, where he was received with the
highest honour. Later works were <i>Three Books of Song</i>, <i>Aftermath</i>,
and <i>Ultima Thule</i>. He <i>d.</i> on March 14, 1882. L. lacked the
intensity of feeling and power of imagination to make him a great
poet; but few poets have appealed to a wider circle of readers. If
he never soars to the heights or sounds the deeps of feeling he touches
the heart by appealing to universal and deep-seated affections. He
was a man of noble and chivalrous character.</p>

<a name='LYDGATE_JOHN_1370_1451'></a><p><b>LYDGATE, JOHN (1370?-1451?).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Suffolk, was
ordained a priest in 1397. After studying at Oxf., Paris, and
Padua, he taught literature in his monastery at Bury St. Edmunds.
He appears to have been a bright, clear-minded, earnest man, with a
love of the beautiful, and a faculty of pleasant, flowing verse. He
wrote copiously and with tiresome prolixity whatever was required
of him, moral tales, legends of the saints, and histories, and his total
output is enormous, reaching 130,000 lines. His chief works are
<i>Troy Book</i> (1412-20), written at the request of Henry V. when Prince
of Wales, <i>The Falls of Princes</i> (1430-38), and <i>The Story of Thebes</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1420). These books were first <i>printed</i> in 1513, 1494, and <i>c.</i> 1500
respectively. L. also wrote many miscellaneous poems. He was
for a time Court poet, and was patronised by Humphrey, Duke of
Gloucester; but the greater part of his life was spent in the monastery
at Bury St. Edmunds. He was an avowed admirer of Chaucer,
though he largely follows the French romancists previous to him.</p><br />

<a name='LYELL_SIR_CHARLES_1797_1875'></a><p><b>LYELL, SIR CHARLES (1797-1875).</b>
&mdash;Geologist and writer,
<i>s.</i> of Charles L., of Kinnordy, Forfarshire (a distinguished botanist
and student of Dante), was brought up near the New Forest. After
going to school at various places in England, he was sent to Oxf.,
where under Buckland he imbibed a taste for science. He studied
law, and was called to the Bar, but soon devoted himself to geology,
and made various scientific tours on the Continent, the results of his
investigations being <i>pub.</i> chiefly in the Transactions of the Geological
Society, of which he was afterwards repeatedly Pres. His two chief
works are <i>The Principles of Geology</i> (1830-33), and <i>The Elements of
Geology</i> (1838). In these books he combated the necessity of
stupendous convulsions, and maintained that the greatest geologic
changes might be produced by remote causes still in operation. He
also <i>pub.</i>, among other works, <i>Geological Evidence of the Antiquity of
Man</i> (1863). He was Prof. of Geology in King's Coll., London,
1831-33, Pres. of the British Association 1864, knighted in 1848,
and <i>cr.</i> a Baronet in 1864. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.
In his later years he was generally recognised as the greatest of
living geologists.</p><br />

<a name='LYLY_JOHN_1554_1606'></a><p><b>LYLY, JOHN (1554?-1606).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist and miscellaneous
writer, was <i>b.</i> in the Weald of Kent, and <i>ed.</i> at both Oxf. and
Camb. He wrote several dramas, most of which are on classical
and mythological subjects, including <i>Campaspe</i> and <i>Sapho and
Phao</i> (1584), <i>Endymion</i> (1591), and <i>Midas</i> (1592). His chief fame,
<a name='Page_247'></a>however, rests on his two didactic romances, <i>Euphues, the Anatomy of
Wit</i> (1579), and <i>Euphues and his England</i> (1580). These works, which
were largely inspired by Ascham's <i>Toxophilus</i>, and had the same objects
in view, viz., the reform of education and manners, exercised a
powerful, though temporary, influence on the language, both written
and spoken, commemorated in our words &quot;euphuism&quot; and &quot;euphuistic.&quot;
The characteristics of the style have been set forth as &quot;pedantic
and far-fetched allusion, elaborate indirectness, a cloying
smoothness and drowsy monotony of diction, alliteration, punning,
and such-like puerilities, which do not, however, exclude a good deal
of wit, fancy, and prettiness.&quot; Many contemporary authors, including
Shakespeare, made game of it, while others, <i>e.g.</i> Greene,
admired and practised it. L. also wrote light dramatic pieces for
the children of the Chapel Royal, and contributed a pamphlet,
<i>Pappe with an Hatchet</i> (1589) to the Mar-prelate controversy in
which he supported the Bishops. He sat in Parliament for some
years.</p><br />

<i>Dialogues of the Dead</i> (1760), which had great popularity, and a

&mdash;Novelist
and statesman, third son of General
Earle Bulwer of Heydon and Dalling, Norfolk, and of Elizabeth
Lytton, heiress of Knebworth, Herts, was <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i>
privately and at Camb. He began to write when still a boy, and
<i>pub.</i>, in 1820, <i>Ismael and other Poems</i>. His marriage in 1825 to
Rosina Wheeler, an Irish beauty, caused a quarrel with his mother,
and the loss of his income, and thus incidentally gave the impulse to
his marvellous literary activity. The marriage proved an unhappy
one, and was terminated by a separation in 1836. During its continuance,
however, his life was a busy and productive one, its
literary results including <i>Falkland</i> (1827), <i>Pelham</i> (1828), <i>Paul Clifford</i>
(1830), <i>Eugene Aram</i> (1832), <i>The Pilgrims of the Rhine</i>, <i>Last
Days of Pompeii</i>, <i>Rienzi</i> (1835), besides <i>England and the English</i>,<a name='Page_248'></a>
<i>Athens its Rise and Fall</i>, and innumerable tales, essays, and articles
in various reviews and magazines, including the <i>New Monthly</i>, of
which he became ed. in 1831. In the same year he entered Parliament
as a Liberal, but gradually gravitated towards Conservatism,
and held office in the second government of Lord Derby as Colonial
Sec. 1858-59. As a politician he devoted himself largely to questions
affecting authors, such as copyright and the removal of taxes upon
literature. He continued his literary labours with almost unabated
energy until the end of his life, his works later than those already
mentioned including the <i>Last of the Barons</i> (1843), <i>Harold</i> (1848), the
famous triad of <i>The Caxtons</i> (1850), <i>My Novel</i> (1853), and <i>What will
he do with it?</i> (1859); and his studies in the supernatural, <i>Zanoni</i>
(1842), and <i>A Strange Story</i> (1862). Later still were <i>The Coming
Race</i> (1870) and <i>Kenelm Chillingly</i> (1873). To the drama he contributed
three plays which still enjoy popularity, <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>,
<i>Richelieu</i>, both (1838), and <i>Money</i> (1840). In poetry he was less
successful. <i>The New Timon</i>, a satire, is the best remembered,
largely, however, owing to the reply by Tennyson which it brought
down upon the author, who had attacked him. In his works,
numbering over 60, L. showed an amazing versatility, both in subject
and treatment, but they have not, with perhaps the exception
of the Caxton series, kept their original popularity. Their faults are
artificiality, and forced brilliancy, and as a rule they rather dazzle
by their cleverness than touch by their truth to nature. L. was
raised to the peerage in 1866.</p>

and Florence. Subsequently he held various diplomatic appointments
at other European capitals. In 1873 he succeeded his <i>f.</i>

Earl on his retirement in 1880, and was in 1887 appointed Ambassador
at Paris, where he <i>d.</i> in 1891. He valued himself much more
as a poet than as a man of affairs; but, though he had in a considerable
degree some of the qualities of a poet, he never quite succeeded
in commanding the recognition of either the public or the critics. His
writings, usually appearing under the pseudonym of &quot;Owen Meredith,&quot;

(1860), <i>Chronicles and Characters</i> (1868), <i>Orval, or the Fool of Time</i>
(1869), <i>Fables in Song</i> (1874), and <i>King Poppy</i> (1892). As Viceroy

<a name='MACAULAY_THOMAS_BABINGTON_LORD_1800_1859'></a><p><b>MACAULAY, THOMAS BABINGTON, LORD (1800-1859).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
essayist, and statesman, <i>s.</i> of Zachary M., a wealthy
merchant, and one of the leaders of the anti-slavery party, was <i>b.</i> at
Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, and <i>ed.</i> at a private school and at
Trinity Coll., Camb., of which he became a Fellow in 1824, and
where, though he gained distinction as a classical scholar and
debater, he did not take a high degree, owing to his weakness in
mathematics. About the time of his leaving the Univ. his prospects
were entirely changed by the failure of his father's firm. He accordingly
read law, and in 1826 was called to the Bar, which led to his
appointment two years later as a Commissioner in Bankruptcy. He
had by this time made his first appearance in print, in <i>Knight's
Quarterly Magazine</i>, and in 1825 he formed the connection with the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> which redounded so greatly to the fame of both.
His first contribution was the famous essay on Milton, which,
although he afterwards said of it that &quot;it contained scarcely a paragraph
which his matured judgment approved,&quot; took the reading
public by storm, and at once gave him access to the first society in
London, in which his extraordinary conversational powers enabled
him to take a leading place. He now began to turn his mind
towards public life, and by favour of Lord Lansdowne sat in the
House of Commons for his family borough of Calne. Entering the
House in 1830 in the thick of the Reform struggle, M. at once leaped
into a foremost place as a debater, and after the passage of the
Reform Bill sat as one of the two members for the new borough of
Leeds, and held office as Sec. to the Board of Control. The acquaintance
with Indian affairs which he thus gained led to his appointment
as a member of the Supreme Council of India, whither he went in
1834. Here his chief work was the codification of the criminal law,
which he carried out with great ability, and by which he wrote his
name on the history of the empire. By the regard for the rights of
the natives which he showed, he incurred much ill-will in interested
quarters. For this he consoled himself with the pleasures of literature,
which gradually assumed the preponderance in his mind over
political ambitions. In 1838 he returned to England. The next
year he began <i>The History of England</i>, but for some time to come
his energies were still divided between this task, the demands of
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and politics. He was elected for Edin., for
which he sat until 1847, when he was thrown out on the Maynooth
question, and from 1839-41 was Sec. for War. The <i>Lays of
Ancient Rome</i> were <i>pub.</i> in 1842, and a collection of his essays in
<i>The Edinburgh</i> the following year. In 1846 he joined the government
of Lord John Russell as Paymaster-General, an office with
light duties, his retirement from which, however, followed the loss
of his seat in the next year. He was now finally set free for his
great work, which became thenceforth the leading interest of his life.
The first and second vols. appeared in 1848, and were received with
extraordinary applause. In 1852 he was offered, but declined, a
seat in the coalition government of Lord Aberdeen, accepting, however,
the seat in Parliament which Edin., now repentant, gave him
<a name='Page_250'></a>unsolicited. His health began about this time to show symptoms
of failure, and he spoke in the House only once or twice. In 1855
the third and fourth vols. of the <i>History</i> came out, and meeting with
a success both at home and in America unprecedented in the case
of an historical work, were translated into various foreign languages.
In 1857 M. was raised to the Peerage, a distinction which he appreciated
and enjoyed. His last years were spent at Holly Lodge,
Kensington, in comparative retirement, and there he <i>d.</i> on December
28, 1859. Though never <i>m.</i>, M. was a man of the warmest family
affections. Outside of his family he was a steady friend and a
generous opponent, disinterested and honourable in his public life.
Possessed of an astonishing memory, knowledge of vast extent, and
an unfailing flow of ready and effective speech, he shone alike as a
parliamentary orator and a conversationalist. In his writings he
spared no pains in the collection and arrangement of his materials,
and he was incapable of deliberate unfairness. Nevertheless, his
mind was strongly cast in the mould of the orator and the pleader:
and the vivid contrasts, antitheses, and even paradoxes which were
his natural forms of expression do not always tend to secure a
judicial view of the matter in hand. Consequently he has been
accused by some critics of party-spirit, inaccuracy, and prejudice.
He has not often, however, been found mistaken on any important
matter of fact, and in what he avowedly set himself to do, namely,
to give a living picture of the period which he dealt with, he has been
triumphantly successful. Unfortunately, strength and life failed
before his great design was completed. He is probably most widely
known by his <i>Essays</i>, which retain an extraordinary popularity.</p>

learning which it displays, and was the means of vindicating the
great Reformer from a cloud of prejudice and misunderstanding in
which he had been enveloped. It was followed by a <i>Life of Andrew<a name='Page_251'></a>

<a name='MACDONALD_GEORGE_1824_1905'></a><p><b>MACDONALD, GEORGE (1824-1905).</b>
&mdash;Poet and novelist, <i>s.</i>
of a farmer, was <i>b.</i> at Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and <i>ed.</i> at the Univ. of
Aberdeen, and at the Independent Coll., Highbury. He became
minister of a congregation at Arundel, but after a few years retired,
on account partly of theological considerations, partly of a threatened,
breakdown of health. He then took to literature, and <i>pub.</i> his first
book, <i>Within and Without</i> (1856), a dramatic poem, <i>Poems</i> followed
in 1857, and <i>Phantasies, a Faerie Romance</i>, in 1858. He then turned
to fiction, and produced numerous novels, of which <i>David Elginbrod</i>
(1862), <i>Alec Forbes</i> (1865), <i>Robert Falconer</i> (1868), <i>The Marquis of
Lossie</i> (1877), and <i>Sir Gibbie</i> (1879), are perhaps the best. He also
wrote stories for children of great charm and originality, including
<i>The Princess and the Goblin</i>, <i>At the Back of the North Wind</i>, and
<i>Ranald Bannerman's Boyhood</i>. As a novelist he had considerable
narrative and dramatic power, humour, tenderness, a genial
view of life and character, tinged with mysticism, and within his
limits was a true poet. On retiring from the ministry he attached
himself to the Church of England, but frequently preached as a layman,
never accepting any remuneration for his sermons.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet and journalist, <i>s.</i>
of a naval officer, was <i>b.</i> at Perth, and <i>ed.</i> at the Royal Caledonian
Asylum, London, and at Brussels, but much of his early life was
spent in France. Coming to London in 1834, he engaged in journalism,
<i>pub.</i> <i>Songs and Poems</i> (1834), wrote a <i>History of London</i>, <i>Popular
Delusions</i>, and a romance, <i>Longbeard</i>. His fame, however, chiefly
rests upon his songs, some of which, including <i>Cheer, Boys, Cheer</i>,
were in 1846 set to music by Henry Russell, and had an astonishing
popularity. In 1852 he became ed. of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>,
in the musical supplement to which other songs by him were set
to old English music by Sir H.R. Bishop. M. acted as <i>Times</i>
correspondent during the American Civil War, and in that capacity
discovered and disclosed the Fenian conspiracy. He had the degree
of LL.D. from Glasgow in 1846.</p><br />

of Seaforth, was <i>ed.</i> at St. Andrews, Aberdeen, and Bourges, called
to the Bar in 1659, in 1677 became Lord Advocate, in which
capacity he was the subservient minister of the persecuting policy
of Charles II. in Scotland, and the inhumanity and relentlessness
of his persecution of the Covenanters gained for him the name of
&quot;Bloody Mackenzie.&quot; In private life, however, he was a cultivated
and learned gentleman with literary tendencies, and is remembered
as the author of various graceful essays, of which the best known is
<i>A Moral Essay preferring Solitude to Public Employment</i> (1665). He
also wrote legal, political, and antiquarian works of value, including
<i>Institutions of the Law of Scotland</i> (1684), <i>Antiquity of the Royal Line
of Scotland</i> (1686), <i>Heraldry</i>, and <i>Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland
<a name='Page_252'></a>from the Restoration of Charles II.</i>, a valuable work which was not

He studied for the law, and became Controller of Taxes for Scotland.
He was the author of three novels, <i>The Man of Feeling</i> (1771), <i>The
Man of the World</i> (1773), and <i>Julia de Roubign&eacute;</i> (1777), all written in
a strain of rather high-wrought sentimentalism, in which the influence
of Sterne is to be seen. He was also a leading contributor
to <i>The Mirror</i> and <i>The Lounger</i>, two periodicals somewhat in the
style of the <i>Spectator</i>. In his later days he was one of the leading

the army and landowner, <i>ed.</i> at Aberdeen, whence he proceeded
to Edinburgh to study medicine, in which he <i>grad.</i> in 1787. In the
following year he went to London, where he wrote for the press
and studied law, and in 1791 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Vindici&aelig; Gallic&aelig;</i> in answer
to Burke's <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i>, which was well
received by those who, in its earlier stages, sympathised with
the Revolution, and procured for him the friendship of Fox,
Sheridan, and other Whigs. Called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in
1795, he delivered before that society in 1799 a brilliant course of
lectures on <i>The Law of Nature and Nations</i>, which greatly increased
his reputation. In 1804 he went out to India as Recorder of
Bombay, and two years later was appointed a Judge of the Admiralty
Court. He remained in India until 1811, discharging his
official duties with great efficiency. After his return he entered
Parliament in 1813 as member for Nairnshire, and attained a considerable
reputation as a forcible and informing speaker on questions
of criminal law and general politics. On the accession of the
Whigs in 1830 he was made a member of the Board of Control for
India. He also held from 1818-24 the Professorship of Law and
General Politics at Haileybury. His true vocation, however, was
to literature, and it is to be regretted that so much of his time
and strength was withdrawn from it, his writings being confined to
a <i>Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy</i> in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i>, a sketch of the History of England for Lardner's
<i>Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, a Life of Sir Thomas More for the same, a fragment
of a projected <i>History of the Revolution of 1688</i>, and some
articles in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.</p><br />

for Scotland. His main contribution to literature is his original
and learned book, <i>Primitive Marriage</i> (1865). Another work, <i>The
Patriarchal Theory</i>, left unfinished, was completed by his brother
(1884). These works and other papers by M. gave a great impulse
to the study of the problems with which they deal, and cognate
questions. M. received the degree of LL.D. from Aberdeen in 1874.</p><br />

<a name='MACPHERSON_JAMES_1736_1796'></a><p><b>MACPHERSON, JAMES (1736?-1796).</b>
&mdash;Alleged translator
of the Ossianic poems, <i>s.</i> of a small farmer at Ruthven, Inverness-shire,
studied for the Church at Aberdeen and Edin., became teacher
of the school in his native parish, and afterwards tutor in a gentleman's
family. In 1758 he <i>pub.</i> <i>The Highlander</i>, an ambitious poem in
6 cantos, which, however, attracted no attention. But in the following
year he submitted to <a href='#HOME_JOHN_1722_1808'>John Home</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), the author of <i>Douglas</i>,
certain writings which he represented to be translations from
ancient Gaelic poems. By the help of Home and some of his friends
M. was enabled to <i>pub.</i> a considerable number of his <i>Fragments of
Poetry translated from the Gaelic and Erse Languages</i>. These were
received with profound and widely-spread interest, and gave rise to
a controversy which can hardly yet be said to be settled. While
some authorities received them with enthusiastic admiration, others
immediately called their genuineness in question. In the first instance,
however, a subscription was raised to enable M. to make a
journey in search of further poetic remains, the result of which was
the production in 1761 of <i>Fingal</i>, an epic in 6 books, and in 1763 of
<i>Temora</i>, also an epic, in 8 books. The fame which these brought to
their discoverer was great, and the sales enormous. In 1764 M.
went as sec. to the Governor of Pensacola in Florida. Returning
in 1766 he settled in London, became an energetic pamphleteer in
support of the Government, and in 1780 entered Parliament, and
was next year appointed to the lucrative post of Agent for the Nabob
of Arcot. He retired in 1789, and bought an estate in his native
<a name='Page_254'></a>parish, where he <i>d.</i> in 1796. Great doubt still rests upon the subject
of the Ossianic poems: it is, however, generally admitted that M.
took great liberties with the originals, even if they ever really existed
in anything at all resembling the form given in the alleged translations.
No manuscripts in the original have ever been forthcoming.
Few, however, will deny that M. either discovered, or composed, a
body of poetry unlike anything that has preceded it, of unequal
merit, indeed, but containing many striking and beautiful passages,
and which unquestionably contributed to break up the tyranny of
the classical school and thus prepare the way for the romantic
revival.</p><br />

and became a leading contributor to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, under the
signature of &quot;Father Prout.&quot; He was witty and learned in many
languages. One form which his humour took was the professed
discovery of the originals in Latin, Greek, or medi&aelig;val French of
popular modern poems and songs. Many of these <i>jeux d'esprit</i>

office he held until his election in 1878 as Master of Trinity Hall.
He became Whewell Prof. of International Law at Camb. in 1887,

and in 1723 went to London as tutor in the family of the Duke of
Montrose. In the following year appeared his ballad of <i>William and
Margaret</i>, by which he is chiefly remembered, and which made him
known to Pope, Young, and others. In 1726 he changed his name
to Mallet to make it more pronounceable by Southern tongues. His
<i>Excursion</i>, an imitation of Thomson, was <i>pub.</i> in 1728. At the request
of the Prince of Wales, whose sec. he had become, he wrote with
Thomson a masque, <i>Alfred</i> (1740), in which <i>Rule Britannia</i> first
appeared, which, although he claimed the authorship, is now
generally attributed to Thomson. He also wrote a <i>Life of Bacon</i>;
and on Bolingbroke bequeathing to him his manuscripts and library,
he <i>pub.</i> an ed. of his works (1754). On the accession of George III.,
M. became a zealous supporter of Lord Bute, and was rewarded with
a sinecure. In addition to the works above named M. wrote some

Acute, careful, and sensible, he was a useful contributor to the study
of Shakespeare, of whose works he <i>pub.</i> a valuable ed. in 1790. He
also aided in the detection of the Rowley forgeries of Chatterton,
and the much less respectable Shakespeare ones of Ireland. At his
death he was engaged upon another ed. of Shakespeare, which was
brought out under the editorship of <a href='#BOSWELL_JAMES_1740_1795'>James Boswell</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). M. also

made to identify him with a Sir Thomas Malory of Warwickshire,
who fought successively on both sides in the Wars of the Roses, sat
in Parliament 1444-45, and <i>d.</i> 1471. In his book he strove to make a

&mdash;Economist, <i>s.</i>
of a landed proprietor, was <i>b.</i> near Dorking, and <i>ed.</i>. at Jesus Coll.,
Camb., of which he became a Fellow. Taking orders he became
incumbent of Albury, Essex. He travelled much on the continent,
collecting information as to the means of livelihood and mode of life
of various peoples. In 1798 the first ed. of his famous <i>Essay on
Population</i> appeared, and in 1803 a second greatly enlarged. Its
leading proposition, supported by much learning, is that while population
increases approximately in a geometrical ratio, the means of
subsistence do so in an arithmetical ratio only, which, of course,
opened up an appalling prospect for the race. It necessarily failed to
take into account the then undreamed-of developments whereby the
produce of the whole world has been made available for all nations.
The work gave rise to a great deal of controversy, much of it
based on misunderstanding. M. was Prof. of Political Economy at
Haileybury.</p><br />

came over to England to practise his profession. In 1705 he <i>pub.</i> a
short poem, <i>The Grumbling Hive</i>, which in 1714 reappeared with a
prose commentary, and various dissertations on the origin of moral
virtue, etc., as <i>The Fable of the Bees, or Private Vices Public Benefits</i>,
and in 1729 was made the subject of a persecution for its immoral
tendency. It was also vigorously combated by, among others,
Bishop Berkeley and William Law, author of <i>The Serious Call</i>.
While the author probably had no intention of subverting morality,
his views of human nature were assuredly cynical and degrading in
a high degree. Another of his works, <i>A Search into the Nature of
Society</i> (1723), appended to the later versions of the <i>Fable</i>, also
startled the public mind, which his last works, <i>Free Thoughts on
Religion</i> and <i>An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour and the Usefulness

most of his education from a priest who instructed him in several
modern languages. He then became a lawyer's clerk, and was later
an assistant in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. He contributed
<a name='Page_257'></a>verses of very various merit to a number of Irish newspapers,
and translations from the German to <i>The Dublin University Magazine</i>.
By some critics his poetical powers were considered to be such as
to have gained for him the first place among Irish poets; but his
irregular and intemperate habits prevented him from attaining any
sure excellence. His best work, generally inspired by the miseries
of his country, often rises to a high level of tragic power, and had
his strength of character been equal to his poetic gift it is difficult
to say to what heights he might have attained. He <i>d.</i> of cholera.</p><br />

John M. Her subsequent career was one of highly dubious morality,
but considerable literary success. Her principal works are <i>The New
Atalantis</i> (<i>sic</i>) (1709), a satire in which great liberties were taken
with Whig notabilities, <i>Memoirs of Europe</i> (1710), and <i>Court Intrigues</i>
(1711). She also wrote three plays, <i>The Royal Mischief</i>, <i>The

ablest of the Tractarian party. He was rector of Woollavington-cum-Graffham
1833, and Archdeacon of Chichester 1840. In 1851
he entered the Church of Rome, in which he attached himself to the
Ultramontane party. More even than Newman he was the leading
spirit of the Roman Church in England. His writings consist of
sermons, of which he <i>pub.</i> several vols. before his secession from the
Church of England, and controversial works, including <i>Petri Privilegium</i>
(1871), <i>The Vatican Decrees</i> (1875), in answer to Gladstone's

des P&eacute;ch&eacute;s</i>, a book written in French verse by William of Waddington,
is practically a collection of tales and short stories on the
Commandments, Seven Deadly Sins, Sacraments, etc., and is of
value as giving a contemporary picture of the time. He also made
(<i>c.</i> 1335) a translation in verse of the French <i>Chronicle</i> of Peter Langtoft,

<a name='MANSEL_HENRY_LONGUEVILLE_1820_1871'></a><p><b>MANSEL, HENRY LONGUEVILLE (1820-1871).</b>
&mdash;Metaphysician,
<i>s.</i> of a clergyman, was <i>b.</i> at Cosgrave, Northamptonshire,
<a name='Page_258'></a>and <i>ed.</i> at Merchant Taylors' School and Oxf. He took orders, was
Reader in Theology at Magdalen Coll. 1855, Bampton Lecturer 1858,
Prof. of Ecclesiastical History 1867, and Dean of St. Paul's 1869.
Among his writings are <i>Prolegomena Logica</i> (1851), <i>The Limits of
Demonstrative Science</i> (1853), <i>Man's Conception of Eternity</i> (1854),
<i>Limits of Religious Thought</i> (1858), <i>Philosophy of the Conditioned</i>
(1866). He was also joint ed. of Sir. W. Hamilton's <i>Lectures</i>.</p><br />

<a name='MAP_or_MAPES_WALTER_DE_fl_1200'></a><p><b>MAP, or MAPES, WALTER DE (<i>fl.</i> 1200).</b>
&mdash;Ecclesiastical
statesman and romancist. Most of the facts about him are gleaned
from his <i>De Nugis Curialium</i> (Of the Trifles of the Courtiers), a miscellany
of contemporary notes and anecdotes, throwing much light
on the manners and opinions of the Court of Henry II. He was <i>b.</i>
probably in Herefordshire, and had Celtic blood in his veins, his <i>f.</i> had
rendered service to the King, and he had studied at Paris, and on his
return attended the Court, where he found favour, and obtained preferment
both in Church and State, and in 1173 was a travelling
justice. Thereafter he attended the King, probably as chaplain, on
his foreign wars, represented him at the French Court, and went to
Rome to the Lateran Council of 1179. After the death of Henry II.
he seems to have continued in favour under Richard I. and John,
and was Archdeacon of Oxf. in 1196. M. is the reputed author of
some at least of the <i>Golias</i> poems, rough satires on the vices of the
clergy, but his great work, which has influenced the future of English
literature, was his systematising and spiritualising the Arthurian
legends with additions of his own, including the legends of <i>Launcelot</i>,
of the <i>Quest of the Holy Grail</i>, and of the <i>Morte d' Arthur</i>.</p><br />

<a name='MARKHAM_GERVASE_1568_1637'></a><p><b>MARKHAM, GERVASE (1568?-1637).</b>
&mdash;Translator and miscellaneous
writer, served as a soldier in the Low Countries and Ireland.
Retiring into civil life about 1593 he displayed extraordinary
industry as a translator, compiler, and original writer. Among his
original writings are a poem on the <i>Revenge</i> (1595) (Sir R. Grenville's
ship), a continuation of Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>, <i>The Discourse of Horsemanshippe</i>
(1593), <i>The Young Sportsman's Instructor</i>, <i>Country Contentments</i>
(1611), and various books on agriculture; also plays and
poems, some of the latter of which are religious.</p><br />

<a name='MARLOWE_CHRISTOPHER_1564_1593'></a><p><b>MARLOWE, CHRISTOPHER (1564-1593).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist, <i>s.</i> of
a shoemaker at Canterbury, where he was <i>b.</i>, was <i>ed.</i> at the King's
School there, and in 1581 went to Benet's (now Corpus Christi)
Coll., Camb., where he graduated B.A. 1583, and M.A. in 1587. Of
his life after he left the Univ. almost nothing is known. It has,
however, been conjectured, partly on account of his familiarity with
military matters, that he saw service, probably in the Low Countries.
His first play, <i>Tamburlaine</i>, was acted in 1587 or 1588. The story
is drawn from the Spanish Life of Timur by Pedro Mexia. Its resounding
splendour, not seldom passing into bombast, won for it
immediate popularity, and it long held the stage. It was followed
in 1604 by <i>Faustus</i>, a great advance upon <i>Tamburlaine</i> in a dramatic
sense. The absence of &quot;material horror&quot; in the treatment, so
different in this respect from the original legend, has often been
remarked upon. M.'s handling of the subject was greatly admired
by Goethe, who, however, in his own version, makes the motive
knowledge, while M. has power, and the medi&aelig;val legend pleasure.<a name='Page_259'></a>
In his next play, <i>The Jew of Malta</i>, M. continues to show an advance
in technical skill, but the work is unequal, and the Jew Barabas is to
Shylock as a monster to a man. In <i>Edward II.</i>, M. rises to his
highest display of power. The rhodomontade of <i>Tamburlaine</i> and
the piled-up horror of <i>The Jew</i> are replaced by a mature self-restraint,
and in the whole workmanship he approaches more nearly to Shakespeare
than any one else has ever done. Speaking of it Lamb says,
&quot;The death scene of Marlowe's King moves pity and terror beyond
any scene, ancient or modern, with which I am acquainted.&quot; M. is
now almost certainly believed to have had a large share in the three
parts of <i>Henry VI.</i>, and perhaps also he may have collaborated in
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>. His next plays, <i>The Massacre of Paris</i> and <i>The
Tragedy of Dido</i> (written with <a href='#NASH_THOMAS_1567_1601'>Nash</a>, <i>q.v.</i>), both show a marked falling
off; and it seems likely that in his last years, perhaps, breaking
down under the effects of a wild life, he became careless of fame as of
all else. Greene, in his <i>Groat's Worth of Wit</i>, written on his deathbed,
reproaches him with his evil life and atheistic opinions, and a
few days before his hapless death an information was laid against
him for blasphemy. The informer was next year hanged for an
outrageous offence, and his witness alone might not be conclusive,
but M.'s life and opinions, which he made no secret of, were notorious.
On the other hand, his friends, Shakespeare, Nash, Drayton, and
Chapman, all make kindly reference to him. To escape the plague
which was raging in London in 1593, he was living at Deptford,
then a country village, and there in a tavern brawl he received a
wound in the head, his own knife being turned against him by a
serving man, upon whom he had drawn it. The quarrel was
about a girl of the town. The parish record bears the entry,
&quot;Christopher Marlowe, slain by ffrancis Archer, the 1 of June
1593.&quot; M. is the father of the modern English drama, and the introducer
of the modern form of blank verse. In imagination, richness
of expression, originality, and general poetic and dramatic
power he is inferior to Shakespeare alone among the Elizabethans.
In addition to his plays he wrote some short poems (of which the
best known is <i>Come live with me and be my love</i>), translations from
Ovid's <i>Amores</i> and Lucan's <i>Pharsalia</i>, and a glowing paraphrase of
Musaeus' <i>Hero and Leander</i>, a poem completed by Chapman.</p>

&mdash;Dramatist, <i>s.</i> of
a country gentleman of Northamptonshire, was <i>ed.</i> at Oxford. After
a youth of extravagance, he fought in the Low Countries. His
writings consist of an epic, <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>, and three comedies,
<i>Holland's Leaguer</i>, <i>A Fair Companion</i>, and <i>The Antiquary</i>. His
plays show some power of satire, and were popular, but he had little
of the dramatist.</p><br />

<a name='MARRYAT_FREDERICK_1792_1848'></a><p><b>MARRYAT, FREDERICK (1792-1848).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>s.</i> of a
West India merchant, was <i>b.</i> in London. In 1806 he entered the
navy as a midshipman under Lord Cochrane (afterwards Earl of
Dundonald), and saw much service in the Mediterranean, at Walcheren,
and in the Burmese War of 1824. He returned in 1830 as a<a name='Page_260'></a>
Captain and C.B. The scenes and experiences through which he had
passed were the preparation for and the foundation of his numerous
novels, of which the first, <i>Frank Mildmay</i>, was <i>pub.</i> in 1829. It was
followed by over 30 others, of which perhaps the best are <i>Peter
Simple</i>, <i>Jacob Faithful</i> (1834), <i>Mr. Midshipman Easy</i> (1836), <i>The
Dog Fiend</i> (1837), and <i>The Phantom Ship</i> (1839). M. is the prince of
sea story-tellers; his knowledge of the sea, vigorous definition of
character, and hearty and honest, if somewhat broad, humour never
failing to please.</p><br />

<a name='MARSH_HERBERT_1757_1839'></a><p><b>MARSH, HERBERT (1757-1839).</b>
&mdash;Theologian and controversialist,
<i>s.</i> of a clergyman, <i>ed.</i> at Canterbury, Cambridge, and
Leipsic, was the first to introduce the German methods of Biblical
criticism into England, and gave lectures on the subject at Camb.,
which excited great interest and controversy. In 1816 he was made
Bishop of Llandaff, and was translated to Peterborough in 1819.
His critical views and his opposition to the evangelical party in the
Church, to the Bible Society, to hymns in Divine service, and to
Catholic emancipation, involved him in controversy with high, low,
and broad churchmen alike. He was the author of a <i>History of the
Politics of Great Britain and France</i> (1799), <i>Comparative View of the
Churches of England and Rome</i>, and <i>Hor&aelig; Pelasgic&aelig;</i>.</p><br />

<a name='MARSTON_JOHN_1575_1634'></a><p><b>MARSTON, JOHN (1575?-1634).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist and satirist,
<i>b.</i> at Coventry, was <i>ed.</i> at Oxf. In later life he gave up writing for
the stage, took orders, and was incumbent of Christchurch, Hants,
1616-31. He began his literary career in 1598 with satire, <i>The
Scourge of Villanie</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis of Pygmalion's Image</i>
(1598), the latter of which was burned by order of Archbishop Whitgift.
In 1602 appeared <i>The History of Antonio and Mellida</i>, and its
sequel, <i>Antonio's Revenge</i>, ridiculed by Ben Jonson. In repayment
of this M. co-operated with Dekker in attacking Jonson in <i>Satiromastix</i>
(a Whip for the Satirist). A reconciliation, however, took
place, and his comedy, <i>The Malcontent</i> (1604), was dedicated to J.,
another, <i>Eastward Ho</i> (1605), was written in collaboration with
him and Chapman. Other plays of his are <i>Sophonisba</i>, <i>What You
Will</i> (1607), and possibly <i>The Insatiate Countess</i> (1613). Amid much
bombast and verbiage there are many fine passages in M.'s dramas,
especially where scorn and indignation are the motives. Sombre and
caustic, he has been called &quot;a screech-owl among the singing birds.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='MARSTON_PHILIP_BOURKE_1850_1887'></a><p><b>MARSTON, PHILIP BOURKE (1850-1887).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i>
in London, and lost his sight at the age of 3. His poems, <i>Song-tide</i>,
<i>All in All</i>, and <i>Wind Voices</i> bear, in their sadness, the impress of this
affliction, and of a long series of bereavements. He was the friend
of Rossetti and of Swinburne, the latter of whom has written a
sonnet to his memory.</p><br />

<a name='MARTIN_SIR_THEODORE_1816_1909'></a><p><b>MARTIN, SIR THEODORE (1816-1909).</b>
&mdash;Poet, biographer,
and translator, <i>s.</i> of James M., solicitor in Edin., where he was <i>b.</i> and
<i>ed.</i> at the High School and Univ. He practised as a solicitor in
Edin. 1840-45, after which he went to London and became head of
the firm of Martin and Leslie, parliamentary agents. His first contribution
to literature was <i>The Bon Gaultier Ballads</i>, written along
with <a href='#AYTOUN_WILLIAM_EDMONSTONE_1813_1865'>W.E. Aytoun</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), full of wit and humour, which still retain
<a name='Page_261'></a>their popularity; originally contributed to a magazine, they appeared
in book form in 1855. His translations include <i>Dante's Vila
Nuova</i>, &OElig;hlenschl&auml;ger's <i>Correggio</i> and <i>Aladdin</i>, Heine's <i>Poems and
Ballads</i>, Schiller's <i>Song of the Bell</i>, and Hertz's <i>King Ren&eacute;'s Daughter</i>.
He also <i>pub.</i> a complete translation of Horace with a Life, and one of
Catullus. He is, however, perhaps best known for his <i>Life of the
Prince Consort</i> (1874-80), the writing of which was committed to him
by Queen Victoria, a work which he executed with such ability and
tact as to win for him her lifelong friendship. He also wrote Lives
of Prof. Aytoun and Lord Lyndhurst. He <i>m.</i> in 1851 Miss Helen
Faucit (<i>d.</i> 1898), the well-known actress, and authoress of studies
on <i>Shakespeare's Female Characters</i>, whose Life he <i>pub.</i> in 1901. M.
kept up his intellectual activity into old age, <i>pub.</i> in 1905 a translation
of Leopardi's poems, and <i>Monographs</i> (1906). He was Lord
Rector of St. Andrews 1881, LL.D. of Edin. 1875, and K.C.B. 1880.</p><br />

<a name='MARTINEAU_HARRIET_1802_1876'></a><p><b>MARTINEAU, HARRIET (1802-1876).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and economist,
<i>b.</i> at Norwich, where her <i>f.</i>, descended from a French family,
was a manufacturer. From her earliest years she was delicate and
very deaf, and took to literary pursuits as an amusement. Afterwards,
when her <i>f.</i> had fallen into difficulties, they became her means
of support. Her first publication was <i>Devotional Exercises for Young
Persons</i> (1823). Becoming interested in political economy, she
endeavoured to illustrate the subject by tales, of which two were
<i>The Rioters</i> and <i>The Turn-out</i>. Later she <i>pub.</i> a more serious treatment
of it in <i>Illustrations of Political Economy</i> (1832-4), <i>Poor Law
and Paupers</i> (1833), and <i>Illustrations of Taxation</i> (1834). About
this time she went to London, and was regarded as an authority
on economic questions, being occasionally consulted by Cabinet
Ministers. Among her books of travel are <i>Society in America</i>
(1837), and <i>Eastern Life, Present and Past</i> (1848), which she considered
her best book: in it she declared herself no longer a believer
in revelation. She also wrote two novels, <i>Deerbrook</i> (1839),
and <i>The Hour and the Man</i> (1840), also a number of books for
children. Perhaps her most important work is her <i>History of
England during the Thirty Years' Peace</i>, 1816-46, which appeared
in 1849. She translated Comte's <i>Philosophy</i> (1853), and <i>pub.</i> a
collection of letters between herself and Mr. H.G. Atkinson <i>On the
Laws of Man's Nature and Development</i>, which encountered severe
criticism. In addition to her separate publications she wrote innumerable
articles for newspapers, specially the <i>Daily News</i>, and for
periodicals. In 1845 she settled in the Lake District, where she died.</p><br />

<a name='MARTINEAU_JAMES_1805_1900'></a><p><b>MARTINEAU, JAMES (1805-1900).</b>
&mdash;Unitarian theologian,
younger brother of the above, was <i>b.</i> at Norwich. Possessed of considerable
inventive and mathematical talents, he was originally intended
for engineering, but studied for the Unitarian ministry, to
which he was ordained in 1828. After serving as pastor in various
places he became in 1840 Prof. of Mental and Moral Philosophy in
the Manchester New Coll. (subsequently removed to London), and
Principal 1869-85. Among his writings, which were very influential,
are <i>Rationale of Religious Inquiry</i> (1836), <i>Ideal Substitutes for God</i>
(1879), <i>Study of Spinoza</i> (1882), <i>Types of Ethical Theory</i> (1885), <i>Study
of Religion</i> (1888), <i>Seat of Authority in Religion</i> (1890), and religious
<a name='Page_262'></a>poems and hymns. M. was a man of very elevated character and
powerful intellect; of great acuteness, candour, and openness to
new ideas. He was D.D. of Edin. 1884, and D.C.L. of Oxf. 1888.</p><br />

<a name='MARVELL_ANDREW_1621_1678'></a><p><b>MARVELL, ANDREW (1621-1678).</b>
&mdash;Poet and satirist, <i>s.</i> of
the Rector of Winestead, Yorkshire, where he was <i>b.</i>, <i>ed.</i> Camb., and
thereafter travelled in various Continental countries. He sat in
Parliament for Hull, proving himself an assiduous and incorruptible
member, with strong republican leanings. In spite of this he was a
favourite of Charles II., who took pleasure in his society, and offered
him a place at Court, and a present of &pound;1000, which were both declined.
In his own day he was best known as a powerful and fearless
political writer, and for some time from 1657 was assistant to Milton
as Latin Sec. After the Restoration he wrote against the Government,
his chief work in this kind being on the <i>Growth of Popery and
Arbitrary Government in England</i> (1677). He was also the author
of an <i>Historical Essay regarding General Councils</i>. His controversial
style was lively and vigorous, but sometimes coarse and vituperative.
His fame now rests on his poems which, though few, have
many of the highest poetical qualities. Among the best known are
<i>The Emigrants in the Bermudas</i>, <i>The Nymph complaining for the
Death of her Fawn</i>, and <i>Thoughts in a Garden</i>. Of the last Palgrave
says that &quot;it may be regarded as a test of any reader's insight
into the most poetical aspects of poetry,&quot; and his <i>Horatian Ode on
Cromwell's Return from Ireland</i>. The town of Hull voted him a
monument, which was, however, forbidden by the Court. His appearance
is thus described, &quot;He was of middling stature, pretty strong-set,
roundish-faced, cherry-cheeked, hazel-eyed, brown-haired.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Life and Works</i> by Cooke, 1726, reprinted 1772; Thomson, 1726;
Dove, 1832; and specially Grosart (4 vols., 1872-74).</p><br />

<a name='MASON_WILLIAM_1724_1797'></a><p><b>MASON, WILLIAM (1724-1797).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a clergyman,
was <i>b.</i> at Hull, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb. He took orders and rose to be a
Canon of York. His first poem was <i>Mus&aelig;us</i>, a monody on the death
of Pope, and his other works include <i>Elfrida</i> (1752), and <i>Caractacus</i>
(1759), dramas&mdash;an <i>Heroic Epistle</i> to Sir William Chambers, the
architect, in which he satirised some modern fashions in gardening,
<i>The English Garden</i>, his largest work, and some odes. He was a
close friend of Gray, whose Life he wrote. His language was too
magnificent for his powers of thought, but he has passages where the
rich diction has a pleasing effect.</p><br />

<a name='MASSEY_GERALD_1828_1907'></a><p><b>MASSEY, GERALD (1828-1907).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> near Tring,
Herts. As a boy he worked in a silk-factory, and as a straw-plaiter
and errand boy. When he was 15 he came to London, where he was
taken up by Maurice and Kingsley. His first book was <i>pub.</i> in 1851,
but he first attracted attention by <i>Babe Christabel</i> (1854). This was
followed by <i>War Waits</i>, <i>Craigcrook Castle</i>, and <i>Havelock's March</i>. A
selection from these was <i>pub.</i> 1889, under the title of <i>My Lyrical Life</i>.
Later he wrote and lectured on spiritualism, and produced prose
works on the origin of myths and mysteries in <i>The Book of Beginnings</i>
(1881), <i>The Natural Genesis</i> (1883), and <i>Ancient Egypt: the
Light of the World</i> (1907). He also wrote a book on the sonnets of
Shakespeare. M. had a true lyrical vein, but though often musical,
<a name='Page_263'></a>he was at times harsh and rugged, and did not give sufficient attention
to form and finish.</p><br />

<a name='MASSINGER_PHILIP_1583_1640'></a><p><b>MASSINGER, PHILIP (1583-1640).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist, was probably
<i>b.</i> at Salisbury. His <i>f.</i> appears to have been a retainer of the
Earl of Pembroke, by whom and by Queen Elizabeth he was employed
in a confidential capacity. M. was at Oxf., but quitted the
Univ. suddenly without graduating. He is next found in London
writing for the stage, frequently in collaboration with others. Few
details of his life have come down, but it seems that he was on the
whole unfortunate. He was found dead in bed on March 16, 1640,
and was buried in St. Saviour's, Southwark, by some of the actors.
The burial register has the entry, &quot;buried Philip Massinger, a
stranger.&quot; Of the many plays which he wrote or had a hand in, 15
believed to be entirely his are extant, other 8 were burned by a
servant in the 18th century. He, however, collaborated so much
with others&mdash;Fletcher, Dekker, etc., that much fine work probably
his can only be identified by internal evidence. Among his plays
may be mentioned <i>The Unnatural Combat</i> (<i>pr.</i> 1639), <i>The Virgin
Martyr</i> (1622) (partly by Dekker), which contains perhaps his finest
writing. His best plays on the whole, however, are <i>The City
Madam</i> (1632), and <i>A New Way to pay Old Debts</i> (<i>pr.</i> 1633), which
latter kept the stage until the 19th century. He is believed to have
joined with Fletcher and Shakespeare in <i>Henry VIII.</i> and <i>The Two
Noble Kinsmen</i>. Other plays which he wrote or had a hand in are
<i>The Duke of Milan</i>, <i>The Bondman</i>, <i>The Renegado</i>, <i>The Roman Actor</i>,
<i>The Great Duke of Florence</i>, <i>The Maid of Honour</i>, <i>The Picture</i>, and
<i>The Fatal Dowry</i>. His verse is fluent and sweet, and in his grave and
reflective passages he rises to a rich and stately music. He often
repeats himself, has little humour, and is not seldom coarse. He has,
however, much skill in the construction and working out of a story.</p><br />

<a name='MASSON_DAVID_1822_1907'></a><p><b>MASSON, DAVID (1822-1907).</b>
&mdash;Biographer and historian,
<i>b.</i> at Aberdeen, and <i>ed.</i> at Marischal Coll. there and at Edin., where
he studied theology under Chalmers. He did not, however, enter
the Church, but began a literary career by ed. a newspaper in Aberdeen.
He then returned to Edin., where he worked for the brothers
Chambers, the eminent publishers, and where he became acquainted
with Wilson, Sir William Hamilton, and Chalmers, for the last of
whom he cherished an extraordinary veneration. Going to London
in 1847 he wrote extensively in reviews, magazines, and encyclop&aelig;dias.
In 1852 he became Prof. of English Literature in Univ.
Coll., and in 1858 ed. of <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>. He was appointed
in 1865 Prof. of English Literature in Edin., where he exercised a
profound influence on his students, many of whom have risen to
high positions in literature. Though a most laborious student and
man of letters, M. took a warm interest in various public questions,
including Italian emancipation, and the higher education of women.
He was the author of many important works, including <i>Essays Biographical
and Critical</i> (1856), <i>British Novelists</i> (1859), and <i>Recent
British Philosophy</i> (1865). His <i>magnum opus</i> is his monumental
<i>Life of John Milton</i> (6 vols., 1859-80) the most complete biography of
any Englishman, dealing as it does not only with the personal life of
the poet, but with the history, political, social, and religious of his
<a name='Page_264'></a>time. Other books are <i>Drummond of Hawthornden</i> (1873), <i>De
Quincey</i> (in English Men of Letters Series) (1878), <i>Edinburgh Sketches
and Memories</i> (1892), and <i>Carlyle Personally and in his Writings</i>.
He also ed. the standard ed. of De Quincey's works, and the Register
of the Privy Council of Scotland, his introductions in connection
with which are of great historical value. He was appointed Historiographer
for Scotland in 1893. M. was full of learning guided by
sagacity, genial, broad-minded, and sane in his judgments of men
and things, and thoroughly honest and sincere.</p><br />

extremely bigoted and self-sufficient. He carried on a persecution
of so-called &quot;witches,&quot; which led to the shedding of much innocent
blood; on the other hand he was so much of a reformer as to
advocate inoculation for small-pox. He was a copious author, his
chief work being <i>Magnalia Christi Americana</i> (1702), an ecclesiastical
history of New England. Others were <i>Late Memorable Providences
relating to Witchcraft and Possession</i> (1689), and <i>The Wonders of the
Invisible World</i> (1693). In his later years he admitted that &quot;he
had gone too far&quot; in his crusade against witches.</p><br />

He was an accomplished Italian scholar, and made various translations
from the English into Italian, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. He also produced
a fine ed. of Gray, on which he lost heavily. His chief work,
however, was <i>The Pursuits of Literature</i> (1794), an undiscriminating
satire on his literary contemporaries which went through 16 ed.,
but is now almost forgotten.</p><br />

&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i>
in Dublin of Huguenot ancestry, was <i>ed.</i> at Trinity Coll. there, and
taking orders held various benefices. He was the author of a few
dramas, one of which, <i>Bertram</i>, had some success. He is, perhaps,
better known for his romances in the style of Mrs. Radcliffe and
&quot;Monk&quot; Lewis. The first of these, <i>The Fatal Revenge</i> appeared in
1807, and was followed by, among others, <i>The Milesian Chief</i> (1812),
<i>Women</i>, which was the most successful, and lastly by <i>Melmoth</i>, in
which he outdoes his models in the mysterious, the horrible, and
indeed the revolting, without, except very occasionally, reaching
their power. His last work, <i>The Albigenses</i>, in a somewhat different
style, was <i>pub.</i> in the year of his death.</p><br />

<a name='MAURICE_FREDERICK_DENISON_1805_1872'></a><p><b>MAURICE, FREDERICK DENISON (1805-1872).</b>
&mdash;Divine, <i>s.</i>
of a Unitarian minister, was <i>b.</i> at Normanston, near Lowestoft, and
studied at Camb., but being then a Dissenter, could not graduate.
He went to London, and engaged in literary work, writing for the
<i>Westminster Review</i> and other periodicals, and for a short time ed.
the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>. His theological views having changed, he joined
the Church of England, went to Oxf., graduated, and was ordained
1834. He became Chaplain to Guy's Hospital, and held other
clerical positions in London. In 1840 he was appointed Prof. of<a name='Page_265'></a>
English Literature and History at King's Coll., and subsequently
Prof. of Theology. He became a leader among the Christian socialists,
and for a short time ed. their paper. On the publication of his
<i>Theological Essays</i> in 1853 he was asked to resign his professorship
at King's Coll. In 1854 he was one of the founders of the Working
Men's Coll., of which he became Principal, and in 1866 he was made
Prof. of Moral Philosophy at Camb. Among his writings are <i>The
Religions of the World and their Relation to Christianity</i>, <i>Moral and
Metaphysical Philosophy</i>, <i>The Prophets and Kings of the Old Testament</i>
(1853), <i>The Doctrine of Sacrifice</i>, and <i>Theological Essays</i>. M.'s
style was copious, and was often blamed as obscure; nevertheless,
he exercised an extraordinary influence over some of the best minds
of his time by the originality of his views, and the purity and elevation
of his character.</p><br />

he took orders, but was deprived of his living for non-residence.
His novels, <i>O'Hara</i>, and <i>Stories from Waterloo</i>, started

Company to ed. the <i>Rig Veda</i>. He settled at Oxf. in 1848, and in
1850 was appointed deputy Taylorian Prof. of Modern European
languages, becoming Prof. 4 years later, and Curator of the Bodleian
Library in 1856. In 1868 he was elected first Prof. of Comparative
Philology. He ed. <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>, and wrote in English

<a name='MAY_THOMAS_1595_1650'></a><p><b>MAY, THOMAS (1595-1650).</b>
&mdash;Poet and historian, <i>b.</i> in
Sussex, <i>s.</i> of Sir Thomas M., of Mayfield, went to Camb., and thence
to Gray's Inn, but discarded law for literature. In 1622 he produced
his first comedy, <i>The Heir</i>, and also a translation of Virgil's
<i>Georgics</i>. Six years later, 1627, appeared his translation of <i>Lucan</i>,
which gained him the favour of Charles I. at whose command he
wrote two poems, <i>The Reigne of King Henry II.</i>, and <i>The Victorious
Reigne of King Edward III.</i>, each in 7 books. When the Civil War
broke out M., to the disappointment of his friends, took the side of
the Parliament, and was made Sec. to the Long Parliament, the
historian of which he became, <i>pub.</i> 1647, <i>The History of the Parliament
of England, which began Nov. 3, 1640</i>. This work he prefaced
with a short review of the preceding reigns from that of Elizabeth.
The narrative closes with the Battle of Newbury, 1643, and is characterised
by fulness of information and candour. M. was also the
author of several tragedies, including <i>Antigone</i>, of no great merit.</p><br />

treatise on the laws, privileges, etc., of Parliament, which, first <i>pub.</i>
in 1844, reached in 1901 its tenth ed., and was translated into various
languages. His <i>Constitutional History of England</i>, 1760-1860 is
practically a continuation of Hallam's great work. He also wrote

York, and took to the sea, which led to strange adventures, including
an imprisonment of some months in the hands of cannibals in
the Marquesas Islands. His first novel, <i>Typee</i> (1846), is based upon
this experience. <i>Omoo</i> followed in 1847, <i>Moby Dick, or the White
Whale</i>, a powerful sea story, in 1852, and <i>Israel Potter</i> in 1855.
He was a very unequal writer, but occasionally showed considerable
power and originality.</p><br />

great reformer and scholar, Andrew M., by whom, when Principal
of the Univ. of Glasgow, he was chosen to assist him as a regent
or professor. When, in 1580, Andrew became Principal of St.
Mary's Coll., St. Andrews, James accompanied him, and acted as
Prof. of Hebrew and Oriental Languages. He wrote many poems,
but his chief work was his <i>Diary</i>, an original authority for the
period, written with much na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and revealing a singularly attractive
personality. M., who for his part in Church matters, had
been banished to England, <i>d.</i> at Berwick on his way back to
Scotland.</p><br />

<a name='MELVILLE_SIR_JAMES_1535_1617'></a><p><b>MELVILLE, SIR JAMES (1535-1617).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of Sir
John M., of Hallhill, was a page to Mary Queen of Scots at the
French Court, and afterwards one of her Privy Council. He also
acted as her envoy to Queen Elizabeth and the Elector Palatine.
He was the author of an autobiography which is one of the original
authorities for the period. The MS., which lay for long hidden in
Edin. Castle, was discovered in 1660, and <i>pub.</i> 1683. A later ed.
was brought out in 1827 by the Bannatyne Club. The work is
<a name='Page_267'></a>written in a lively style, but is not always to be implicitly relied upon
in regard either to facts or the characters attributed to individuals.</p><br />

<a name='MEREDITH_GEORGE_1828_1909'></a><p><b>MEREDITH, GEORGE (1828-1909).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and poet, <i>b.</i>
at Portsmouth, <i>s.</i> of Augustus M., a naval outfitter, who afterwards
went to Cape Town, and <i>ed.</i> at Portsmouth and Neuwied in Germany.
Owing to the neglect of a trustee, what means he had inherited
were lost, and he was in his early days very poor. Articled
to a lawyer in London, he had no taste for law, which he soon
exchanged for journalism, and at 21 he was writing poetry for
magazines, his first printed work, a poem on the Battle of Chillianwallah,
appearing in <i>Chambers's Journal</i>. Two years later he <i>pub.</i>
<i>Poems</i> (1851), containing <i>Love in the Valley</i>. Meantime he had been
ed. a small provincial newspaper, and in 1866 he was war correspondent
in Italy for the <i>Morning Post</i>, and he also acted for many years
as literary adviser to Chapman and Hall. By this time, however,
he had produced several of his novels. <i>The Shaving of Shagpat</i> had
appeared in 1856, <i>Farina</i> in 1857, <i>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</i> in
1859, <i>Evan Harrington</i> in 1861, <i>Emilia in England</i> (also known as
<i>Sandra Belloni</i>) in 1864, its sequel, <i>Vittoria</i>, in 1866, and <i>Rhoda
Fleming</i> in 1865. In poetry he had produced <i>Modern Love and
Poems of the English Roadside</i> (1862), generally regarded as his best
poetical work. These were followed by <i>The Adventures of Harry
Richmond</i> (1871), <i>Beauchamp's Career</i> (1875), said to be the author's
favourite, <i>The Egoist</i> (1879), which marks the beginning of a change
in style characterised by an even greater fastidiousness in the choice
of words, phrases, and condensation of thought than its predecessors,
<i>The Tragic Comedians</i> (1880), and <i>Diana of the Crossways</i>,
the first of the author's novels to attain anything approaching
general popularity. The same period yielded in poetry, <i>Poems and
Lyrics of the Joy of Earth</i> (1883), <i>Ballads and Poems of Tragic Life</i>
(1887), and <i>A Reading of Earth</i> (1888). His later novels, <i>One of our
Conquerors</i> (1891), <i>Lord Ormont and his Aminta</i> (1894), and <i>The
Amazing Marriage</i> (1895), exhibit a tendency to accentuate those
qualities of style which denied general popularity to all of M.'s
works, and they did little to add to his reputation. The contemporary
poems include <i>The Empty Purse</i> and <i>Jump to Glory Jane</i>
(1892). In 1905 he received the Order of Merit, and he <i>d.</i> on May
19, 1909. He was twice <i>m.</i>, his first wife, who <i>d.</i> 1860, being a
<i>dau.</i> of <a href='#PEACOCK_THOMAS_LOVE_1785_1866'>Thomas Love Peacock</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). This union did not prove in
all respects happy. His second wife was Miss Vulliamy, who <i>d.</i>
1885. In his earlier life he was vigorous and athletic, and a great
walker; latterly he lost all power of locomotion.</p>

<p>Though the writings of M. never were and probably never will be
generally popular, his genius was, from the very first, recognised by
the best judges. All through he wrote for the reader who brought
something of mind, thought, and attention, not for him who read
merely to be amused without trouble; and it is therefore futile to
attribute failure to him because he did not achieve what he did not
aim at. Nevertheless, the long delay in receiving even the kind of
recognition which he sought was a disappointment to him. Few
writers have striven to charge sentences and even words so heavily
with meaning, or to attain so great a degree of condensation, with
<a name='Page_268'></a>the result that links in the chain of thought are not seldom omitted
and left for the careful reader to supply. There is also a tendency
to adopt unusual words and forms of expression where plainness and
simplicity would have served as well, and these features taken together
give reason for the charges of obscurity and affectation so
often made. Moreover, the discussion of motive and feeling is
often out of proportion to the narrative of the events and circumstances
to which they stand related. But to compensate us for
these defects he offers humour, often, indeed, whimsical, but keen
and sparkling, close observation of and exquisite feeling for nature,
a marvellous power of word-painting, the most delicate and
penetrating analysis of character, and an invincible optimism
which, while not blind to the darker aspects of life, triumphs over
the depression which they might induce in a weaker nature. In
matters of faith and dogma his standpoint was distinctly negative.</p><br />

a keen student of Roman history, and between 1850 and 1864 he
<i>pub.</i> his <i>History of the Romans under the Empire</i>, an able and scholarly

Edin., but failed. He went to Oxf., where he was corrector for the
Clarendon Press. After various literary failures and minor successes
he produced his translation of the <i>Lusiad</i>, from the Portuguese of
Camoens, which brought him both fame and money. In 1777 he
went to Portugal, where he was received with distinction. In 1784
he <i>pub.</i> the ballad of <i>Cumnor Hall</i>, which suggested to Scott the
writing of <i>Kenilworth</i>. He is perhaps best remembered, however,
by the beautiful lyric, <i>There's nae luck aboot the Hoose</i>, which,
although claimed by others, is almost certainly his.</p><br />

several latitudinarian treatises on miracles, etc., which brought him
into controversy with <a href='#WATERLAND_DANIEL_1683_1740'>Waterland</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) and others, and of a <i>Life of<a name='Page_269'></a>

&mdash;Dramatist, was a
Londoner and city chronologer, in which capacity he composed a
chronicle of the city, now lost. He wrote over 20 plays, chiefly
comedies, besides masques and pageants, and collaborated with
Dekker, Webster, and other playwrights. His best plays are <i>The
Changeling</i>, <i>The Spanish Gipsy</i> (both with Rowley), and <i>Women
beware Women</i>. Another, <i>The Game of Chess</i> (1624), got the author
and the players alike into trouble on account of its having brought
the King of Spain and other public characters upon the stage. They,
however, got off with a severe reprimand. M. was a keen observer
of London life, and shone most in scenes of strong passion. He is,
however, unequal and repeats himself. Other plays are: <i>The Ph&oelig;nix</i>,
<i>Michaelmas Term</i> (1607), <i>A Trick to Catch the old One</i> (1608), <i>The
Familie of Love</i> (1608), <i>A Mad World, My Masters</i> (1608), <i>The Roaring
Girl</i> (1611) (with Dekker), <i>The Old Law</i> (1656) (with Massinger
and Rowley), <i>A Faire Quarrel</i> (1617); and among his pageants and

<a name='MILL_JAMES_1773_1836'></a><p><b>MILL, JAMES (1773-1836).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher and historian, <i>s.</i>
of a shoemaker, was <i>b.</i> at Montrose, and showing signs of superior
ability, was sent to the Univ. of Edin. with a view to the ministry.
He was licensed as a preacher in 1798, but gave up the idea of the
Church, and going to London in 1802 engaged in literary work, ed.
the <i>St. James's Chronicle</i>, and wrote for the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. In
1806 he began his <i>History of British India</i> (1817-18), and in 1819
received the appointment of Assistant Examiner to the India Office,
and in 1834 became head of the department. M. had meanwhile
become the intimate friend of Jeremy Bentham, was perhaps the
chief exponent of the utilitarian philosophy, and was also one of the
founders of the London Univ. His philosophical writings include
<i>Elements of Political Economy</i> (1821), and <i>Analysis of the Human
Mind</i> (1824). M.'s intellect was powerful, though rigid and somewhat
narrow; his style was clear and precise, and his conversational
powers very remarkable, and influential in moulding the opinions
of those who came into contact with him, especially his distinguished
son, <a href='#MILL_JOHN_STUART_1806_1873'>John Stuart</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p><br />

<a name='MILL_JOHN_STUART_1806_1873'></a><p><b>MILL, JOHN STUART (1806-1873).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher, <i>s.</i> of the
above, <i>b.</i> in London, was <i>ed.</i> by his <i>f.</i> with the view of making him
the successor of Bentham and himself, as the exponent of the Utilitarian
philosophy. In all respects he proved an apt pupil, and by
his 15th year had studied classical literature, logic, political economy,
and mathematics. In that year he went to France, where he was
under the charge of Sir S. Bentham, a brother of Jeremy. His
studies had led him to the adoption of the utilitarian philosophy, and
after his return he became acquainted with Grote, the Austins, and
other Benthamites. In 1823 he entered the India House as a clerk,
and, like his <i>f.</i>, rose to be examiner of Indian correspondence; and,
<a name='Page_270'></a>on the dissolution of the Company, retired on a liberal pension. In
1825 he ed. Bentham's <i>Rationale of Judicial Evidence</i>. During the
following years he was a frequent contributor to Radical journals,
and ed. the <i>London Review</i>. His <i>Logic</i> appeared in 1843, and produced
a profound impression; and in 1848 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Principles of
Political Economy</i>. The years between 1858 and 1865 were very
productive, his treatises on <i>Liberty</i>, <i>Utilitarianism</i>, <i>Representative
Government</i>, and his <i>Examination of Sir W. Hamilton's Philosophy</i>
being <i>pub.</i> during this period. In 1865 he entered the House of
Commons as one of the members for Westminster, where, though
highly respected, he made no great mark. After this political
parenthesis he returned to his literary pursuits, and wrote <i>The Subjection
of Women</i> (1869), <i>The Irish Land Question</i> (1870), and an
<i>Autobiography</i>. M. had <i>m.</i> in 1851 Mrs. Taylor, for whom he showed
an extraordinary devotion, and whom he survived for 15 years. He
<i>d.</i> at Avignon. His <i>Autobiography</i> gives a singular, and in some
respects painful account of the methods and views of his <i>f.</i> in his
education. Though remaining all his life an adherent of the utilitarian
philosophy, M. did not transmit it to his disciples altogether
unmodified, but, finding it too narrow and rigid for his own intellectual
and moral requirements, devoted himself to widening it, and
infusing into it a certain element of idealism.</p>

<a name='MILLER_HUGH_1802_1856'></a><p><b>MILLER, HUGH (1802-1856).</b>
&mdash;Geologist, and man of
letters, <i>b.</i> at Cromarty, had the ordinary parish school education, and
early showed a remarkable love of reading and power of story-telling.
At 17 he was apprenticed to a stonemason, and his work in quarries,
together with rambles among the rocks of his native shore, led him to
the study of geology. In 1829 he <i>pub.</i> a vol. of poems, and soon
afterwards threw himself as an ardent and effective combatant into
the controversies, first of the Reform Bill, and thereafter of the
Scottish Church question. In 1834 he became accountant in one of
the local banks, and in the next year brought out his <i>Scenes and
Legends in the North of Scotland</i>. In 1840 the popular party in the
Church, with which he had been associated, started a newspaper,
<i>The Witness</i>, and M. was called to be ed., a position which he retained
till the end of his life, and in which he showed conspicuous ability.
Among his geological works are <i>The Old Red Sandstone</i> (1841), <i>Footprints
of the Creator</i> (1850), <i>The Testimony of the Rocks</i> (1856), and
<i>Sketch-book of Popular Geology</i>. Other books are: <i>My Schools and
Schoolmasters</i>, an autobiography of remarkable interest, <i>First Impressions
of England and its People</i> (1847), and <i>The Cruise of the
Betsy</i>. Of the geological books, perhaps that on the old red sandstone,
a department in which M. was a discoverer, is the best: but
all his writings are distinguished by great literary excellence, and
especially by a marvellous power of vivid description. The end of
his life was most tragic. He had for long been overworking his
brain, which at last gave way, and in a temporary loss of reason, he
shot himself during the night.</p>

Taking orders he became in 1835 Rector of St. Margaret's, Westminster,
and in 1849 Dean of St. Paul's. He also held the professorship
of Poetry at Oxf. 1821-31. Among his poetical works may be

Jerusalem</i> (1820), <i>The Martyr of Antioch</i> (1822), and <i>Anne Boleyn</i>
(1826). It is, however, on his work as an historian that his literary
fame chiefly rests, his chief works in this department being his <i>History
of the Jews</i> (1830), <i>History of Christianity</i> (1840), and especially
<i>The History of Latin Christianity</i> (6 vols. 1854-56), which is one of
the most important historical works of the century, characterised

<a name='MILTON_JOHN_1608_1674'></a><p><b>MILTON, JOHN (1608-1674).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i> 9th December
1608 in Bread Street, London. His <i>f.</i>, also John, was the <i>s.</i> of a
yeoman of Oxfordshire, who cast him off on his becoming a
Protestant. He had then become a scrivener in London, and grew
to be a man of good estate. From him his illustrious <i>s.</i> inherited his
lofty integrity, and his love of, and proficiency in, music. M. received
his first education from a Scotch friend of his father's, Thomas
Young, a Puritan of some note, one of the writers of <i>Smectymnuus</i>.
Thereafter he was at St. Paul's School, and in 1625 went to Christ's
Coll., Camb., where for his beauty and his delicacy of mind he was
nicknamed &quot;the lady.&quot; His sister Anne had <i>m.</i> Edward Phillips,
and the death of her first child in infancy gave to him the subject of
his earliest poem, <i>On the death of a Fair Infant</i> (1626). It was followed
during his 7 years' life at the Univ., along with others, by the
poems, <i>On the Morning of Christ's Nativity</i> (1629), <i>On the Circumcision</i>,
<i>The Passion</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>At a Solemn Music</i>, <i>On May Morning</i>,
and <i>On Shakespeare</i>, all in 1630; and two sonnets, <i>To the Nightingale</i>
and <i>On arriving at the Age of Twenty-three</i>, in 1631. In 1632, having
given up the idea of entering the Church, for which his <i>f.</i> had intended
him, he lived for 6 years at Horton, near Windsor, to which
the latter had retired, devoted to further study. Here he wrote
<i>L'Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i> in 1632, <i>Arcades</i> (1633), <i>Comus</i> in 1634,
and <i>Lycidas</i> in 1637. The first celebrates the pleasures of a life of
cheerful innocence, and the second of contemplative, though not
gloomy, retirement, and the last is a lament for a lost friend, Edward<a name='Page_272'></a>
King, who perished at sea. <i>Arcades</i> and <i>Comus</i> are masques set to
music by Henry Lawes, having for their motives respectively family
affection and maiden purity. Had he written nothing else these
would have given him a place among the immortals. In 1638 he
completed his education by a period of travel in France and Italy,
where he visited Grotius at Paris, and Galileo at Florence. The
news of impending troubles in Church and State brought him home
the following year, and with his return may be said to close the first
of three well-marked divisions into which his life falls. These may
be called (1) the period of preparation and of the early poems; (2)
the period of controversy, and of the prose writings; and (3) the
period of retirement and of the later poems. Soon after his return
M. settled in London, and employed himself in teaching his nephews,
Edward and John Phillips, turning over in his mind at the same
time various subjects as the possible theme for the great poem
which, as the chief object of his life, he looked forward to writing.
But he was soon to be called away to far other matters, and to be
plunged into the controversies and practical business which were to
absorb his energies for the next 20 years. The works of this period
fall into three classes&mdash;(1) those directed against Episcopacy, including
<i>Reformation of Church Discipline in England</i> (1641), and his
answers to the writings of <a href='#HALL_JOSEPH_1574_1656'>Bishop Hall</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and in defence of
<i>Smectymnuus</i> (<i>see</i> under Calamy); (2) those relating to divorce, including
<i>The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</i> (1643), and <i>The Four
Chief Places of Scripture which treat of Marriage</i> (1645); and (3)
those on political and miscellaneous questions, including the <i>Tractate
on Education</i> (1644), <i>Areopagitica</i> (1644), <i>A Speech for the Liberty
of Unlicensed Printing</i> (his greatest prose work), <i>Eikonoklastes</i>, an
answer to the <i>Eikon Basilik&eacute;</i> of <a href='#GAUDEN_JOHN_1605_1662'>Dr. Gauden</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>The Tenure of
Kings and Magistrates</i> (1649), in defence of the execution of
Charles I., which led to the furious controversy with Salmasius,
the writing of <i>Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio</i> (1650), the second
<i>Defensio</i> (1654), which carried his name over Europe, and <i>The Ready
and Easy Way to establish a Free Commonwealth</i>, written on the eve
of the Restoration. In 1643 M. had <i>m.</i> Mary Powell, the <i>dau.</i> of an
Oxfordshire cavalier, a girl of 17, who soon found her new life as the
companion of an austere poet, absorbed in severe study, too abrupt
a change from the gay society to which she had been accustomed,
and in a month returned to her father's house on a visit. When
the time fixed for rejoining her husband arrived, she showed no disposition
to do so, upon which he began to aim at a divorce, and to
advocate in the works above mentioned &quot;unfitness and contrariety
of mind&quot; as a valid ground for it, views which incurred for him
much notoriety and unpopularity. A reconciliation, however,
followed in 1645, and three <i>dau.</i> were born of the marriage. In
1649 the reputation of M. as a Latinist led to his appointment as
Latin or Foreign Sec. to the Council of State, in the duties of which
he was, after his sight began to fail, assisted by <a href='#MARVELL_ANDREW_1621_1678'>A. Marvell</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) and
others, and which he retained until the Restoration. In 1652 his
wife <i>d.</i>, and four years later he entered into a second marriage with
Katharine Woodcock, who <i>d.</i> in child-birth in the following year.
To her memory he dedicated one of the most touching of his sonnets.
At the Restoration he was, of course, deprived of his office, and had
<a name='Page_273'></a>to go into hiding; but on the intercession of <a href='#MARVELL_ANDREW_1621_1678'>Marvell</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and
perhaps <a href='#DAVENANT_or_DAVENANT_SIR_WILLIAM_1606_1668'>Davenant</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), his name was included in the amnesty. In
1663, being now totally blind and somewhat helpless, he asked his
friend Dr. Paget to recommend a wife for him. The lady chosen
was Elizabeth Minshull, aged 25, who appears to have given him
domestic happiness in his last years. She survived him for 53
years. The Restoration closed his second, and introduced his third,
and for his fame, most productive period. He was now free to
devote his whole powers to the great work which he had so long contemplated.
For some time he had been in doubt as to the subject,
had considered the Arthurian legends, but had decided upon the
Fall of Man. The result was <i>Paradise Lost</i>, which was begun in
1658, finished in 1664, and <i>pub.</i> in 1667. A remark of his friend,
<a href='#ELLWOOD_THOMAS_1639_1713'>Thomas Ellwood</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), suggested to him the writing of <i>Paradise
Regained</i>, which, along with <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, was <i>pub.</i> in 1671. Two
years before he had printed a <i>History of Britain</i>, written long before,
which, however, is of little value. The work of M. was now done.
In addition to his blindness he suffered from gout, to which it was
partly attributable, and, his strength gradually failing, but with
mind unimpaired and serene, he <i>d.</i> peacefully on November 8, 1674.
In M. the influences of the Renaissance and of Puritanism met. To
the former he owed his wide culture and his profound love of everything
noble and beautiful, to the latter his lofty and austere character,
and both these elements meet in his writings. Leaving
Shakespeare out of account, he holds an indisputable place at the
head of English poets. For strength of imagination, delicate accuracy
and suggestiveness of language, and harmony of versification,
he is unrivalled, and almost unapproached; and when the difficulties
inherent in the subject of his great masterpiece are considered,
the power he shows in dealing with them appears almost miraculous,
and we feel that in those parts where he has failed, success was impossible
for a mortal. In his use of blank verse he has, for majesty,
variety, and music, never been approached by any of his successors.
He had no dramatic power and no humour. In everything he wrote,
a proud and commanding genius manifests itself, and he is one of
those writers who inspire reverence rather than affection. His personal
appearance in early life has been thus described, &quot;He was a
little under middle height, slender, but erect, vigorous, and agile,
with light brown hair clustering about his fair and oval face, with
dark grey eyes.&quot;</p>

time he practised as a solicitor, but becoming acquainted with
<a href='#DAVIS_THOMAS_OSBORNE_1814_1845'>Thomas Davis</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), he associated himself with the Young Ireland
party, and was a leading contributor to the <i>Nation</i> newspaper. His
political sympathies and acts were carried so far as to bring about
in 1848 his trial for treason-felony, and his transportation for 14
years. After his release he resided chiefly at New York, and ed.
various papers, and opposed the abolition of slavery; but in 1874
he was elected M.P. for Tipperary, for which, however, he was declared
incapable of sitting. On a new election he was again returned,
but <i>d.</i> before the resulting petition could be heard. He wrote a <i>Jail
Journal</i>, a work of great power, <i>The Last Conquest of Ireland</i> (<i>perhaps</i>)
(1860), and a <i>History of Ireland</i> of little value.</p><br />

<a name='MITFORD_MARY_RUSSELL_1787_1855'></a><p><b>MITFORD, MARY RUSSELL (1787-1855).</b>
&mdash;Poetess and
novelist, <i>b.</i> at Alresford, Hants, <i>dau.</i> of a physician, without practice,
selfish and extravagant, who ran through three fortunes, his own,
his wife's, and his daughter's, and then lived on the industry of the
last. After a vol. of poems which attracted little notice, she produced
her powerful tragedy, <i>Julian</i>. In 1812, what ultimately
became the first vol. of <i>Our Village</i> appeared in the <i>Lady's Magazine</i>.
To this four additional vols. were added, the last in 1832. In this
work Miss M. may be said to have created a new branch of literature.
Her novel, <i>Belford Regis</i> (1835), is somewhat on the same
lines. She added two dramas, <i>Rienzi</i> (1828), and <i>Foscari</i>, <i>Atherton
and other Tales</i> (1852), and <i>Recollections of a Literary Life</i>, and <i>d.</i> at
her cottage at Swallowfield, much beloved for her benevolent and
simple character, as well as valued for her intellectual powers.</p><br />

&mdash;Historian, <i>e.s.</i> of John
M. of Exbury, Hants, descended from an old Northumbrian family,
was <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i> at Cheam School and Oxf. He studied
law, but on succeeding to the family estates devoted himself to
study and literature, and to his duties as an officer of the militia.
His first <i>pub.</i> was an <i>Essay on the Harmony of Language</i> (1774).
His great work, <i>The History of Greece</i>, is said to have been
undertaken at the suggestion of Gibbon, who was a fellow-officer
in the South Hants Militia. This work, the successive vols. of
<a name='Page_275'></a>which appeared at considerable intervals between 1784 and 1810,
was long a standard one, though it is now largely superseded by
the histories of Thirwall and Grote. M. wrote with strong prejudices
against democracy, and in defence of tyrants, but his style
is forcible and agreeable, and he brought learning and research
to bear on his subject. He sat for many years in Parliament.</p><br />

<a name='MOIR_DAVID_MACBETH_1798_1851'></a><p><b>MOIR, DAVID MACBETH (1798-1851).</b>
&mdash;Poet and miscellaneous
writer, was a doctor at Musselburgh, near Edin., and a frequent
contributor, under the signature of &#916;, to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>
in which appeared <i>Mansie Waugh</i>, a humorous Scottish tale. He
also wrote <i>The Legend of Genevieve</i> (1824), <i>Domestic Verses</i> (1843),
and sketches of the poetry of the earlier half of the 19th century. His
poetry was generally grave and tender, but occasionally humorous.</p><br />

&mdash;Philosopher
and philologist, <i>b.</i> at the family seat in Kincardineshire, was
<i>ed.</i> at the Univ. of Aberdeen, Edin., and Groningen, and called to
the Scottish Bar in 1737. Thirty years later he became a judge with
the title of Lord Monboddo. He was a man of great learning and
acuteness, but eccentric and fond of paradox. He was the author
of two large works alike learned and whimsical, <i>An Essay on the
Origin and Progress of Language</i> (6 vols. 1773-92), and <i>Ancient Metaphysics</i>
(6 vols. 1779-99). He mooted and supported the theory
that men were originally monkeys, and gradually attained to reason,
language, and civilisation by the pressure of necessity. His doctrines
do not sound so absurd now as they did in his own day. He
was visited by Dr. Johnson at Monboddo.</p><br />

&mdash;Critic,
<i>dau.</i> of a gentleman of Yorkshire, <i>m.</i> a grandson of Lord Sandwich.
She was one of the original &quot;blue-stockings,&quot; and her house was a
literary centre. She wrote an <i>Essay on the Writings and Genius of
Shakespeare</i> (1769), in which she compared him with the classical
and French dramatists, and defended him against the strictures of
Voltaire. It had great fame in its day, but has long been superseded.</p><br />

<a name='MONTAGU_LADY_MARY_WORTLEY_PIERREPONT_1690_1762'></a><p><b>MONTAGU, LADY MARY WORTLEY (PIERREPONT) (1690-1762).</b>
&mdash;Letter-writer,
was the eldest <i>dau.</i> of the 1st Duke of Kingston.
In her youth she combined the attractions of a reigning
beauty and a wit. Her early studies were encouraged and assisted
by Bishop Burnet, and she was the friend of Pope, Addison, and
Swift. In 1712 she <i>m.</i>, against the wishes of her family, Edward
Wortley-Montagu, a cousin of the celebrated Charles Montagu,
afterwards Earl of Halifax. Her husband having been appointed
Ambassador to the Porte, she accompanied him, and wrote the
sparkling <i>Letters from the East</i> which have given her a place high
among the great letter-writers of the world. While in Turkey she
became acquainted with the practice of inoculation against smallpox,
which she did much to introduce into western countries. After
her return to England she settled at Twickenham, and renewed her
friendship with Pope, which, however, ended in a violent quarrel,
arising out of her publication of <i>Town Eclogues</i>. She was furiously
attacked by both Pope and Swift, and was not slow to defend herself.
In 1737, for reasons which have never been explained, she left
<a name='Page_276'></a>her husband and country, and settled in Italy. Mr. M. having <i>d.</i>
1761, she returned at the request of her <i>dau.</i>, the Countess of Bute,
but <i>d.</i> the following year.</p><br />

<a name='MONTGOMERIE_ALEXANDER_1545_1610'></a><p><b>MONTGOMERIE, ALEXANDER (1545?-1610?).</b>
&mdash;Poet, probably
<i>b.</i> in Ayrshire, was in the service of the Regent Morton and
James VI., by whom he was pensioned. He is sometimes styled
&quot;Captain,&quot; and was laureate of the Court. He appears to have
fallen on evil days, was imprisoned on the Continent, and lost his
pension. His chief work is <i>The Cherrie and the Slae</i> (1597), a somewhat
poor allegory of Virtue and Vice, but with some vivid description
in it, and with a comparatively modern air. He also wrote
<i>Flyting</i> (scolding) <i>betwixt Montgomerie and Polwart</i>, <i>pub.</i> 1621, and
other pieces.</p><br />

<a name='MONTGOMERY_JAMES_1771_1854'></a><p><b>MONTGOMERY, JAMES (1771-1854).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a pastor
and missionary of the Moravian Brethren, was <i>b.</i> at Irvine, Ayrshire,
and <i>ed.</i> at the Moravian School at Fulneck, near Leeds. After
various changes of occupation and abode, he settled in Sheffield in
1792 as clerk to a newspaper. In 1796 he had become ed. of the
<i>Sheffield Iris</i>, and was twice imprisoned for political articles for
which he was held responsible. In 1797 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Prison Amusements</i>;
but his first work to attract notice was <i>The Wanderer of Switzerland</i>
(1806). It was followed by <i>The West Indies</i> (1809), <i>The World
before the Flood</i> (1812), <i>Greenland</i> (1819), and <i>The Pelican Island</i>
(1828), all of which contain passages of considerable imaginative and
descriptive power, but are lacking in strength and fire. He himself
expected that his name would live, if at all, in his hymns, and in this
his judgment has proved true. Some of these, such as <i>For ever with
the Lord</i>, <i>Hail to the Lord's Anointed</i>, and <i>Prayer is the Soul's sincere
Desire</i>, are sung wherever the English language is spoken. M. was
a good and philanthropic man, the opponent of every form of injustice
and oppression, and the friend of every movement for the
welfare of the race. His virtues attained wide recognition.</p><br />

<a name='MONTGOMERY_ROBERT_1807_1855'></a><p><b>MONTGOMERY, ROBERT (1807-1855).</b>
&mdash;Poet, a minister of
the Scottish Episcopal Church, wrote some ambitious religious
poems, including <i>The Omnipresence of the Deity</i> and <i>Satan</i>, which
were at first outrageously puffed, and had a wide circulation.
Macaulay devoted an essay to the demolition of the author's reputation,
in which he completely succeeded.</p><br />

<a name='MOORE_EDWARD_1712_1757'></a><p><b>MOORE, EDWARD (1712-1757).</b>
&mdash;Fabulist and dramatist,
<i>s.</i> of a dissenting minister, was <i>b.</i> at Abingdon. After being in
business as a linen-draper, in which he was unsuccessful, he took to
literature, and wrote a few plays, of which <i>The Gamester</i> (1753) had
a great vogue, and was translated into various languages. He is
best known by his <i>Fables for the Female Sex</i> (1744), which rank next
to those of <a href='#GAY_JOHN_1685_1732'>Gay</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p><br />

<a name='MOORE_JOHN_1729_or_1730_1802'></a><p><b>MOORE, JOHN (1729 or 1730-1802).</b>
&mdash;Physician and miscellaneous
writer, <i>s.</i> of an Episcopal minister, was <i>b.</i> in Stirling.
After studying medicine at Glasgow, he acted as a surgeon in the
navy and the army, and ultimately settled in Glasgow as a physician.
In 1779 he <i>pub.</i> <i>View of Manners and Society in France, Switzerland,
<a name='Page_277'></a>and Germany</i>, which was well received. A similar work, relating to
Italy, followed in 1781. He is, however, chiefly remembered by his
romance <i>Zeluco</i> (1786?). One or two other novels followed, and his
last works are a <i>Journal during a Residence in France</i> (1792), and
<i>Causes and Progress of the French Revolution</i> (1795), the latter of
which was used both by Scott and Carlyle. M. was one of the friends
of Burns, and was the <i>f.</i> of Sir John M., the hero of Corunna.</p><br />

<a name='MOORE_THOMAS_1779_1852'></a><p><b>MOORE, THOMAS (1779-1852).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Dublin, <i>s.</i> of a
grocer and wine-merchant in a small way, was <i>ed.</i> at Trinity Coll.,
after which he went to London, and studied law at the Middle
Temple, 1799. He took with him a translation of <i>Anacreon</i>, which
appeared, dedicated to the Prince Regent, in 1800, was well received,
and made a position for him. In the following year appeared
<i>Poems by Thomas Little</i>. In 1803 he received the appointment of
Admiralty Registrar at Bermuda, and after visiting the island and
travelling in America, he committed his official duties to a deputy
(an unfortunate step as it proved), and returned to England. The
literary fruit of this journey was <i>Epistles, Odes, and other Poems</i>
(1806). In 1807 M. found his true poetic vocation in his <i>Irish-Melodies</i>&mdash;the
music being furnished by Sir John Stevenson, who
adapted the national airs. The reception they met with was enthusiastic,
and M. was carried at once to the height of his reputation.
They continued to appear over a period of 25 years, and for each of
the 130 songs he received 100 guineas. His charming singing of
these airs, and his fascinating conversational and social powers made
him sought after in the highest circles. In 1815 there appeared
<i>National Airs</i> which, however, cannot be considered equal to the
<i>Melodies</i>. After making various unsuccessful attempts at serious
satire, he hit upon a vein for which his light and brilliant wit eminently
qualified him&mdash;the satirical and pungent verses on men and
topics of the day, afterwards <i>coll.</i> in <i>The Twopenny Post Bag</i>, in
which the Prince Regent especially was mercilessly ridiculed, and
about the same time appeared <i>Fables for the Holy Alliance</i>. In 1818
he produced the <i>Fudge Family in Paris</i>, written in that city, which
then swarmed with &quot;groups of ridiculous English.&quot; <i>Lalla Rookh</i>,
with its gorgeous descriptions of Eastern scenes and manners, had
appeared in the previous year with great applause. In 1818 the
great misfortune of his life occurred through the dishonesty of his
deputy in Bermuda, which involved him in a loss of &pound;6000, and
necessitated his going abroad. He travelled in Italy with Lord
John Russell, and visited Byron. Thereafter he settled for a year
or two in Paris, where he wrote <i>The Loves of the Angels</i> (1823). On
the death of Byron his memoirs came into the hands of Moore, who,
in the exercise of a discretion committed to him, destroyed them.
He afterwards wrote a <i>Life of Byron</i> (1830), which gave rise to much
criticism and controversy, and he also ed. his works. His last
imaginative work was <i>The Epicurean</i> (1827). Thereafter he confined
himself almost entirely to prose, and <i>pub.</i> Lives of Sheridan
(1827), and Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1831). His last work, written
in failing health, was a <i>History of Ireland</i> for Lardner's <i>Cabinet
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, which had little merit. Few poets have ever enjoyed
greater popularity with the public, or the friendship of more men distinguished
<a name='Page_278'></a>in all departments of life. This latter was largely owing
to his brilliant social qualities, but his genuine and independent
character had also a large share in it. He left behind him a mass
of correspondence and autobiographical matter which he committed
to his friend Lord John (afterwards Earl) Russell for publication.

<a name='MORE_HANNAH_1745_1833'></a><p><b>MORE, HANNAH (1745-1833).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous and religious
writer, was one of the five daughters of a schoolmaster at Stapleton,
Gloucestershire. The family removed to Bristol, where Hannah began
her literary efforts. Some early dramas, including <i>The Search after
Happiness</i> and the <i>Inflexible Captive</i> brought her before the public,
and she went to London in 1774, where, through her friend, Garrick,
she was introduced to Johnson, Burke, and the rest of that circle,
by whom she was highly esteemed. After publishing some poems,
now forgotten, and some dramas, she resolved to devote herself to
efforts on behalf of social and religious amelioration, in which she
was eminently successful, and exercised a wide and salutary influence.
Her works written in pursuance of these objects are too
numerous to mention. They included <i>Hints towards forming the
Character of a young Princess</i> (1805), written at the request of the
Queen for the benefit of the Princess Charlotte, <i>C&oelig;lebs in search of a
Wife</i> (1809), and a series of short tales, the <i>Cheap Repository</i>, among
which was the well-known <i>Shepherd of Salisbury Plain</i>. This enterprise,
which had great success, led to the formation of the Religious
Tract Society. The success of Miss M.'s literary labours enabled
her to pass her later years in ease, and her sisters having also retired
on a competency made by conducting a boarding-school in Bristol,
the whole family resided on a property called Barley Grove, which
they had purchased, where they carried on with much success philanthropic
and educational work among the people of the neighbouring
district of Cheddar. Few persons have devoted their talents
more assiduously to the well-being of their fellow-creatures, or with
a greater measure of success.</p><br />

&mdash;Philosopher, <i>b.</i> at Grantham,
and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., took orders, but declined all preferment, including
two deaneries and a bishopric; and also various appointments
in his Univ., choosing rather a quiet life devoted to scholarship
and philosophy, especially the study of writings of Plato and
his followers. He led a life of singular purity and religious devotion,
tinged with mysticism, and his writings had much popularity
and influence in their day. Among them may be mentioned <i>Psychozoia
Platonica</i> (1642), <i>repub.</i> (1647) as <i>Philosophicall Poems</i>,
<i>Divine Dialogues</i> (prose) (1668), <i>The Mystery of Godliness</i>, and <i>The
Mystery of Iniquity</i>. His life was written by his friend Richard
Ward.</p><br />

<a name='MORE_SIR_THOMAS_1478_1535'></a><p><b>MORE, SIR THOMAS (1478-1535).</b>
&mdash;Historical and political
writer, <i>s.</i> of Sir John M., a Justice of the King's Bench, was <i>b.</i> in
London. In his 16th year he was placed in the household of Morton,
Archbishop of Canterbury, who was wont to say, &quot;This child here
<a name='Page_279'></a>waiting at the table ... will prove a marvellous man.&quot; In 1497
he went to Oxf., where he became the friend of Erasmus and others,
and came in contact with the new learning. He studied law at
New Inn and Lincoln's Inn, and for some time thought of entering
the Church. He was, however, in 1504 sent up to Parliament,
where his powerful speaking gained for him a high place. Meanwhile,
he had brilliant success in the Law Courts, and was introduced
by Wolsey to Henry VIII., with whom he soon rose into high
favour. He became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Speaker
of the House of Commons, 1523, and was sent on missions to Charles
V. and Francis I. At length, on the fall of Wolsey, M. was, much
against his will, appointed Lord Chancellor, an office which he filled
with singular purity and success, though he was harsh in his dealings
with persons accused of heresy. But differences with the King soon
arose. M. disapproved of Henry's ecclesiastical policy, as well as of
his proceedings in regard to the Queen, and in 1532 he resigned his
office. In 1534 he refused the oath which pledged him to approval
of the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn, and for this he was imprisoned
in the Tower, and on July 7, 1535, beheaded. His body was buried
in St. Peter's in the Tower, and his head exhibited on London
Bridge, whence it was taken down and preserved by his <i>dau.</i>, the
noble Margaret Roper. All Catholic Europe was shocked at the
news of what was truly a judicial murder. Among his works are a
Life of <i>Picus, Earl of Mirandula</i> (1510), and a <i>History of Richard III.</i>,
written about 1513. His great work, <i>Utopia</i>, was written in Latin
in two books&mdash;the second 1515, and the first 1516. It had immediate
popularity, and was translated into French 1530, English
1551, German 1524, Italian 1548, and Spanish 1790. It gives an
account of an imaginary island and people, under cover of which it
describes the social and political condition of England, with suggested
remedies for abuses. The opinions on religion and politics
expressed in it are not, however, always those by which he was
himself guided. M. wrote many works of controversy, among
which are <i>Dyaloge concerning Heresies</i>, also epigrams and dialogues
in Latin. His pure and religious character, his sweet temper, his
wit, his constancy and fortitude under misfortune combine to render
him one of the most attractive and admirable figures in English
history.</p>

accounts of travels in Persia, Armenia, and Asia Minor; also novels,
<a name='Page_280'></a>in which he exhibits a marvellous familiarity with Oriental manners
and modes of thought. The chief of these are <i>The Adventures of

Hostage</i> (1832), <i>Ayesha</i> (1834), and <i>The Mirza</i> (1841). All these

medicine and keeping schools at various places, went in 1850 to
London, and adopted literature as his profession. He wrote in
periodicals, and from 1859-64 ed. the <i>Examiner</i>. From 1865-89
he was Prof. of English Literature at Univ. Coll. He was the author
of various biographies, including Lives of <i>Palissy</i>, <i>Cornelius Agrippa</i>,
and <i>Clement Marot</i>. His principal work, however, was <i>English
Writers</i> (10 vols. 1864-94), coming down to Shakespeare. His
<i>First Sketch of English Literature</i>&mdash;the study for the larger work&mdash;had
reached at his death a circulation of 34,000 copies.</p><br />

<a name='MORRIS_SIR_LEWIS_1833_1907'></a><p><b>MORRIS, SIR LEWIS (1833-1907).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Penrhyn,
Carnarvonshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Sherborne and Oxf., was called to the
Bar, and practised as a conveyancer until 1880, after which he devoted
himself to the promotion of higher education in Wales, and
became honorary sec. and treasurer of the New Welsh Univ. In
1871 he <i>pub.</i> <i>Songs of Two Worlds</i>, which showed the influence of
Tennyson, and was well received, though rather by the wider public
than by more critical circles. It was followed in 1876-77 by <i>The Epic
of Hades</i>, which had extraordinary popularity, and which, though
exhibiting undeniable talent both in versification and narrative
power, lacked the qualities of the higher kinds of poetry. It deals
in a modern spirit with the Greek myths and legends. Other works
are <i>A Vision of Saints</i>, <i>Gwen</i>, <i>The Ode of Life</i>, and <i>Gycia</i>, a tragedy.</p><br />

<a name='MORRIS_WILLIAM_1834_1896'></a><p><b>MORRIS, WILLIAM (1834-1896).</b>
&mdash;Poet, artist, and socialist,
<i>b.</i> at Walthamstow, and <i>ed.</i> at Marlborough School and Oxf. After
being articled as an architect he was for some years a painter, and
then joined in founding the manufacturing and decorating firm of
Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co., in which Rossetti, Burne-Jones,
and other artists were partners. By this and other means he did
much to influence the public taste in furnishing and decoration.
He was one of the originators of the <i>Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</i>,
to which he contributed poems, tales, and essays, and in 1858 he
<i>pub.</i> <i>Defence of Guenevere and other Poems</i>. <i>The Life and Death of
Jason</i> followed in 1867, <i>The Earthly Paradise</i> in 1868-70, and <i>Love is
Enough</i> in 1875. In the last mentioned year he made a translation
in verse of Virgil's <i>&AElig;neid</i>. Travels in Iceland led to the writing of
<i>Three Northern Love Stories</i>, and the epic of <i>Sigurd the Volsung</i>
(1876). His translation of the <i>Odyssey</i> in verse appeared 1887. A
series of prose romances began with <i>The House of the Wolfings</i> (1889),
<a name='Page_281'></a>and included <i>The Roots of the Mountains</i>, <i>Story of the Glittering
Plain</i>, <i>The Wood beyond the World</i>, <i>The Well at the World's End</i>
(1896), and posthumously <i>The Water of the Wondrous Isles</i>, and
<i>Story of the Sundering Flood</i>. In addition to poems and tales M.
produced various illuminated manuscripts, including two of Fitzgerald's
<i>Omar Khayyam</i>, and many controversial writings, among
which are tales and tracts in advocacy of Socialism. To this class
belong the <i>Dream of John Ball</i> (1888), and <i>News from Nowhere</i>
(1891). In 1890 M. started the Kelmscott Press, for which he designed
type and decorations. For his subjects as a writer he drew
upon classic and Gothic models alike. He may perhaps be regarded
as the chief of the modern romantic school, inspired by the love of
beauty for its own sake; his poetry is rich and musical, and he has a
power of description which makes his pictures live and glow, but his
narratives sometimes suffer from length and slowness of movement.</p>

same time contributing poetry to various periodicals. He had also
antiquarian tastes, and a deep knowledge of the early history of
Scottish ballad literature, which he turned to account in <i>Minstrelsy,
Ancient and Modern</i> (1827), a collection of Scottish ballads with an
historical introduction. In 1830 he became ed. of the <i>Glasgow

where <a href='#HOLMES_OLIVER_WENDELL_1809_1894'>O.W. Holmes</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), afterwards his biographer, was a fellow-student.
After graduating he went to Europe, studied at G&ouml;ttingen
and Berlin, and visited Italy. On his return he studied law, and was
admitted to the Bar in 1837. He did not, however, practise, and
was in 1840 sent to St. Petersburg as Sec. of Legation. Meanwhile,
having <i>pub.</i> two novels, <i>Morton's Hope</i> and <i>Merry Mount</i>, which had
little success, he turned to history, and attracted attention by some
essays in various reviews. Having decided to write an historical
work on Holland, he proceeded in 1851 to Europe to collect materials,
and in 1856 <i>pub.</i> <i>The Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>. It was received
with the highest approval by such critics as Froude and Prescott,
and at once took its place as a standard work. It was followed in
1860 by the first two vols. of <i>The United Netherlands</i>. The following
year M. was appointed Minister at Vienna, and in 1869 at London.
His latest works were a <i>Life of Barneveldt</i>, the Dutch statesman, and
<i>A View of ... the Thirty Years' War</i>. M. holds a high place among
historical writers both on account of his research and accuracy, and
his vivid and dramatic style, which shows the influence of Carlyle<a name='Page_282'></a>.</p><br />

chequered career. He went to Rome in 1578, and <i>pub.</i> <i>The
Englyshe Romayne Life</i>, in which he gives descriptions of rites and
other matters fitted to excite Protestant feeling; and he appears to
have acted practically as a spy upon Roman Catholics. He had a
hand in 18 plays, of which four only are extant, including two on
<i>Robert, Earl of Huntingdon</i> (<i>Robin Hood</i>) (1598), and one on the <i>Life
of Sir John Oldcastle</i>. He was ridiculed by Ben Jonson in <i>The Case
is Altered</i>. He was also a ballad-writer, but nothing of his in this
kind survives, unless <i>Beauty sat bathing in a Spring</i> be correctly
attributed to him. He also wrote city pageants, and translated
popular romances, including <i>Palladino of England</i>, and <i>Amadis of
Gaule</i>. He was made by <a href='#STOW_JOHN_1525_1605'>Stow</a> the antiquary (<i>q.v.</i>) his literary

Renfrewshire 1846-55. He was a sound classical scholar, and <i>pub.</i>
<i>A Critical History of the Language and Literature of Ancient Greece</i>
(5 vols., 1850-57). He held the view that the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> are

account of his connection with the stage. His plays were nearly all

England, near York, and was for his last 16 years confined to the

his main claim to a place in literature. His other writings were
chiefly religious.</p><br />

the author of several vols. of poetry, including <i>St. Paul</i> (1867). He
<a name='Page_283'></a>also wrote <i>Essays Classical and Modern</i>, and Lives of Wordsworth

at the House of Gask (&quot;the auld house&quot;), <i>m.</i> in 1806 her second
cousin, Major Nairne, who on reversal of attainder became 5th Lord
Nairne. On his death, after residing in various places in England,
Ireland, and on the Continent, she settled at the new house of Gask
(the old one having been pulled down in 1801). Of her songs&mdash;87 in
number&mdash;many first appeared anonymously in <i>The Scottish Minstrel</i>
(1821-24); a collected ed. with her name, under the title of <i>Lays' from
Strathearn</i>, was <i>pub.</i> after her death. Although the songs, some of
which were founded on older compositions, had from the first an
extraordinary popularity, the authoress maintained a strict anonymity
during her life. For direct simplicity and poetic feeling Lady
N. perhaps comes nearer than any other Scottish song-writer to
Burns, and many of her lyrics are enshrined in the hearts of her
fellow-countrymen. Among the best of them are <i>The Land of the
Leal</i> (1798), <i>Caller Herrin'</i>, <i>The Laird o' Cockpen</i>, <i>The Auld House</i>,
<i>The Rowan Tree</i>, <i>The Hundred Pipers</i>, and <i>Will ye no come back
Again?</i> The Jacobitism of some of these and many others was, of
course, purely sentimental and poetical, like that of Scott. She was
a truly religious and benevolent character, and the same modesty
which concealed her authorship withdrew from public knowledge
her many deeds of charity.</p><br />

<a name='NAPIER_MARK_1798_1879'></a><p><b>NAPIER, MARK (1798-1879).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of a lawyer

was made Sheriff of Dumfries and Galloway. He <i>pub.</i> Memoirs of
the Napiers, of Montrose, and of Graham of Claverhouse, the last
of which gave rise to much controversy. N. wrote from a strongly
Cavalier and Jacobite standpoint, and had remarkably little of the
judicial spirit in his methods. His writings, however, have some
historical value.</p><br />

<a name='NAPIER_SIR_WILLIAM_FRANCIS_PATRICK_1785_1860'></a><p><b>NAPIER, SIR WILLIAM FRANCIS PATRICK (1785-1860).</b>
&mdash;was
one of the sons of Col. the Hon. George N. and Lady Sarah
Lennox, <i>dau.</i> of the 2nd Duke of Richmond, and the object of a
romantic attachment on the part of George III. One of his brothers
was Sir Charles N., the conqueror of Scinde. Entering the army at
15, he served with great distinction in the Peninsula under Moore
and Wellington. His experiences as a witness and participator in
the stupendous events of the war combined with the possession of
remarkable acumen and a brilliant style to qualify him for the great
work of his life as its historian. <i>The History of the War in the Peninsula
<a name='Page_284'></a>and in the South of France from 1807-14</i> (1828-40) at once took
rank as a classic, and superseded all existing works on the subject.
Though not free from prejudice and consequent bias, it remains a
masterpiece of historical writing, especially in the description of
military operations. It was translated into French, German,
Spanish, Italian, and Persian. N. also <i>pub.</i> <i>The Conquest of Scinde</i>
(1844-46), mainly a defence of his brother Charles, whose life he
subsequently wrote. He became K.C.B. in 1848, and General 1859.</p><br />

&mdash;Satirist, etc., <i>b.</i> at Lowestoft,
<i>ed.</i> at Camb. A reckless life kept him in perpetual poverty,
and a bitter and sarcastic tongue lost him friends and patrons. He
cherished an undying hatred for the Puritans, and specially for
Gabriel Hervey, with whom he maintained a lifelong controversy,
and against whose attacks he defended <a href='#GREENE_ROBERT_1560_1592'>Robert Greene</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). Among
his writings are <i>Anatomy of Absurdities</i> (1589), <i>Have with you to
Saffron Walden</i>, and <i>Pierce Pennilesse, his Supplication to the Divell</i>
(1592), all against the Puritans. In <i>Summer's</i> (a jester of Henry
VIII.) <i>Last Will and Testament</i> occurs the well-known song, &quot;Spring,
the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant King.&quot; <i>Christ's Tears over
Jerusalem</i> (1593) may have indicated some movement towards repentance.
Another work in a totally different style, <i>The Unfortunate
Traveller, or the Life of Jack Wilton</i> (1594), a wild tale, may be
regarded as the pioneer of the novel of adventure. It had, however,
so little success that the author never returned to this kind of fiction.
A comedy, <i>The Isle of Dogs</i> (now lost), adverted so pointedly to
abuses in the state that it led to his imprisonment. His last work
was <i>Lenten Stuffe</i> (1599), a burlesque panegyric on Yarmouth and
its red herrings. N.'s verse is usually hard and monotonous, but he
was a man of varied culture and great ability.</p><br />

&mdash;Quaker theologian, <i>s.</i> of
a Yorkshire yeoman, who, after serving in the Parliamentary army,
joined the Quakers in 1651, became one of Foxe's most trusted
helpers, and exercised a powerful influence. By some of the more
enthusiastic devotees of the sect he was honoured with such blasphemous
titles as &quot;the Lamb of God,&quot; which, however, he did not
arrogate to himself, but asserted that they were ascribed to &quot;Christ
in him.&quot; He was found guilty of blasphemy, pilloried, whipped, and
branded, and cast into prison, from which he was not released until
after the death of Cromwell, when he made public confession and
resumed preaching. He was the author of a number of short works
both devotional and controversial. He ranks high among the
Quakers for eloquence, insight, and depth of thought.</p><br />

a lawyer. He wrote several novels, which show considerable
native power, but little art, and are now almost forgotten. Among
those which show the influence of Byron and Godwin are <i>Keep Cool</i>
(1818), <i>Logan</i> (1822), and <i>Seventy-six</i> (1823). His poems have the

Paris in 1180, where he became a distinguished teacher. Returning,
to England in 1186 he became an Augustinian Canon, and in 1213
Abbot of Cirencester. He is one of our earliest men of learning, and
wrote a scientific work in Latin verse. <i>De Naturis Rerum</i> (<i>c.</i> 1180-94)
in 10 books. Other works are <i>De Laudibus Divin&aelig; Sapienti&aelig;</i> (in
Praise of the Divine Wisdom), and <i>De Contemptu Mundi</i> (on Despising
the World), and some grammatical treatises.</p><br />

&mdash;<i>Dau.</i>
of Sir Thomas Lucas, and a maid of honour to Queen Henrietta.
Maria, <i>m.</i> in 1645 the 1st Duke of Newcastle (then Marquis), whom
she regarded in adversity and prosperity with a singular and almost
fantastic devotion, which was fully reciprocated. The noble pair
collaborated (the Duchess contributing by far the larger share) in
their literary ventures, which filled 12 vols., and consisted chiefly of
dramas (now almost unreadable), and philosophical exercitations
which, amid prevailing rubbish, contain some weighty sayings. One
of her poems, <i>The Pastimes and Recreations of the Queen of Fairies in
Fairyland</i> has some good lines. Her Life of her husband, in which
she rates him above Julius C&aelig;sar, was said by Lamb to be &quot;a jewel
for which no casket was good enough.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='NEWMAN_FRANCIS_WILLIAM_1805_1897'></a><p><b>NEWMAN, FRANCIS WILLIAM (1805-1897).</b>
&mdash;Scholar and
theological writer, brother of Cardinal N., <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i> at
Oxf. After spending three years in the East, he became successively
classical tutor in Bristol Coll., Professor of Classical Literature
in Manchester New Coll. (1840), and of Latin in Univ. Coll., London,
1846-63. Both brought up under evangelical influences, the two
brothers moved from that standpoint in diametrically opposite
directions, Francis through eclecticism towards scepticism. His
writings include a <i>History of the Hebrew Monarchy</i> (1847), <i>The Soul</i>
(1849), and his most famous book, <i>Phases of Faith</i> (1850), a theological
autobiography corresponding to his brother's <i>Apologia</i>, the
publication of which led to much controversy, and to the appearance
of Henry Rogers' <i>Eclipse of Faith</i>. He also <i>pub.</i> <i>Miscellanea</i> in 4 vols.,
a Dictionary of modern Arabic, and some mathematical treatises.
He was a vegetarian, a total abstainer, and enemy of tobacco,
vaccination, and vivisection. Memoir by I.G. Sieveking, 1909.</p><br />

<a name='NEWMAN_JOHN_HENRY_1801_1890'></a><p><b>NEWMAN, JOHN HENRY (1801-1890).</b>
&mdash;Theologian, <i>s.</i> of a
London banker, and brother of the above, was <i>ed.</i> at Ealing and
Trinity Coll., Oxf., where he was the intimate friend of Pusey and
Hurrell Froude. Taking orders he was successively curate of St.
Clement's 1824, and Vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford, 1828. He was also
Vice-principal of Alban Hall, where he assisted Whately, the Principal,
<a name='Page_286'></a>in his <i>Logic</i>. In 1830 he definitely broke with the evangelicalism
in which he had been brought up; and in 1832, accompanied
by H. Froude, went to the South of Europe, and visited Rome.
During this lengthened tour he wrote most of his short poems,
including &quot;Lead Kindly Light,&quot; which were <i>pub.</i> 1834 as <i>Lyra
Apostolica</i>. On his return he joined with Pusey, Keble, and others
in initiating the Tractarian movement, and contributed some of the
more important tracts, including the fateful No. xc., the publication of
which brought about a crisis in the movement which, after two years
of hesitation and mental and spiritual conflict, led to the resignation
by N. of his benefice. In 1842 he retired to Littlemore, and after a
period of prayer, fasting, and seclusion, was in 1845 received into
the Roman Catholic Church. In the following year he went to
Rome, where he was ordained priest and made D.D., and returning
to England he established the oratory in Birmingham in 1847, and
that in London in 1850. A controversy with C. Kingsley, who had
written that N. &quot;did not consider truth a necessary virtue,&quot; led to
the publication of his <i>Apologia pro Vita Sua</i> (1864), one of the most
remarkable books of religious autobiography ever written. N.'s
later years were passed at the oratory at Birmingham. In 1879 he
was summoned to Rome and <i>cr.</i> Cardinal of St. George in Velabro.
Besides the works above mentioned he wrote, among others, <i>The
Arians of the Fourth Century</i> (1833), <i>Twelve Lectures</i> (1850), <i>Lectures
on the Present Position of Catholics</i> (1851), <i>Idea of a University</i>, <i>Romanism
and Popular Protestantism</i>, <i>Disquisition on the Canon of Scripture</i>,
and his poem, <i>The Dream of Gerontius</i>. Possessed of one of the most
keen and subtle intellects of his age, N. was also master of a style
of marvellous beauty and power. To many minds, however, his
subtlety not seldom appeared to pass into sophistry; and his attitude
to schools of thought widely differing from his own was sometimes
harsh and unsympathetic. On the other hand he was able to
exercise a remarkable influence over men ecclesiastically, and in
some respects religiously, most strongly opposed to him. His
sermons place him in the first rank of English preachers.</p>

&mdash;Natural philosopher,
<i>b.</i> at Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, the <i>s.</i> of a small landed proprietor,
and <i>ed.</i> at the Grammar School of Grantham and at Trinity Coll.,
Camb. By propounding the binomial theorem, the differential calculus,
and the integral calculus, he began in 1665 the wonderful
series of discoveries in pure mathematics, optics, and physics,
which place him in the first rank of the philosophers of all time.
He was elected Lucasian Prof. of Mathematics at Camb. in 1669,
and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1672, over which body he
presided for 25 years from 1703. In the same year his new
theory of flight was <i>pub.</i> in a paper before the society. His
epoch-making discovery of the law of universal gravitation was
not promulgated until 1687, though the first glimpse of it had come
to him so early as 1665. The discovery of fluxions, which he claimed,
was contested by Leibnitz, and led to a long and bitter controversy
between the two philosophers. He twice sat in Parliament for his<a name='Page_287'></a>
Univ., and was Master of the Mint from 1699, in which capacity he
presented reports on the coinage. He was knighted in 1705, and <i>d.</i>
at Kensington in 1727. For a short time, after an unfortunate accident
by which a number of invaluable manuscripts were burned, he
suffered from some mental aberration. His writings fall into two
classes, scientific and theological. In the first are included his
famous treatises, <i>Light and Colours</i> (1672), <i>Optics</i> (1704), the <i>Principia</i>
(1687), in Latin, its full title being <i>Philosophi&aelig; Naturalis Principia
Mathematica</i>. In the second are his <i>Observations upon the
Prophecies of Holy Writ</i> and <i>An Historical Account of Two Notable
Corruptions of Scripture</i>. In character N. was remarkable for simplicity,
humility, and gentleness, with a great distaste for controversy,
in which, nevertheless, he was repeatedly involved.

and adventurous life at sea, part of the time on board a man-of-war
and part as captain of a slaver. In 1748 he came under strong
religious convictions, and after acting as a tide-waiter at Liverpool
for a few years, he applied for orders in 1758, and was ordained
curate of Olney in 1764. Here he became the intimate and sympathetic
friend of Cowper, in conjunction with whom he produced
the <i>Olney Hymns</i>. In 1779 he was translated to the Rectory of St.
Mary, Woolnoth, London, where he had great popularity and influence,
and wrote many religious works, including <i>Cardiphonia</i>, and
<i>Remarkable Passages in his Own Life</i>. He lives, however, in his
hymns, among which are some of the best and most widely known
in the language, such as <i>In evil long I took delight</i>, <i>Glorious things of

and was an early opponent of Locke. His poetry, with occasional
fine thoughts, is full of far-fetched metaphors and conceits, and is
not seldom dull and prosaic. From 1692 he held G. Herbert's
benefice of Bemerton. Among his 23 works are <i>An Idea of Happiness</i>
(1683), <i>Miscellanies</i> (1687), <i>Theory and Regulation of Love</i>

interest herself in the amelioration of the laws regarding the social
condition and the separate property of women and the wrongs of
children, and her poems, <i>A Voice from the Factories</i> (1836), and <i>The

&mdash;Novelist and miscellaneous
writer, <i>s.</i> of Sir Anthony O., Chief Justice of Ceylon. The
first 38 years of his life were spent in desultory study, travel, and
adventure, varied by occasional diplomatic employment. His
travels included, besides Continental countries, the shores of the
Black Sea, Circassia, where he was <i>Times</i> correspondent, America,
China, and Japan. He was in the Crimean War, Indian Mutiny,
Chinese War, the military operations of Garibaldi, and the Polish
insurrection, and served as private sec. to Lord Elgin in Washington,
Canada, and China, and as Sec. of Legation in Japan. In 1865 he
entered Parliament, and gave promise of political eminence, when in
1867 he came under the influence of Thomas L. Harris, an American
mystic of questionable character, went with him to America, and
joined the Brotherhood of the New Life. In 1870-71 he was
correspondent for the <i>Times</i> in the Franco-German War. Ultimately
he broke away from the influence of Harris and went to
Palestine, where he founded a community of Jewish immigrants at
Haifa. After revisiting America he returned to England, but immediately
fell ill and <i>d.</i> at Twickenham. O. was a voluminous and
<a name='Page_290'></a>versatile author, publishing books of travel, novels, and works on

&mdash;Novelist
and miscellaneous writer, was <i>b.</i> near Musselburgh.
Her literary output began when she was little more than a girl, and
was continued almost up to the end of her life. Her first novel, <i>Mrs.
Margaret Maitland</i>, appeared in 1849, and its humour, pathos, and
insight into character gave the author an immediate position in
literature. It was followed by an endless succession, of which the
best were the series of <i>The Chronicles of Carlingford</i> (1861-65),
including <i>Salem Chapel</i>, <i>The Perpetual Curate</i>, and <i>Miss Marjoribanks</i>,
all of which, as well as much of her other work, appeared in
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, with which she had a lifelong connection.
Others of some note were <i>The Primrose Path</i>, <i>Madonna Mary</i> (1866),
<i>The Wizard's Son</i>, and <i>A Beleaguered City</i>. She did not, however,
confine herself to fiction, but wrote many books of history and biography,
including <i>Sketches of the Reign of George II.</i> (1869), <i>The
Makers of Florence</i> (1876), <i>Literary History of England</i> 1790-1825,
<i>Royal Edinburgh</i> (1890), and Lives of <i>St. Francis of Assisi</i>, <i>Edward
Irving</i>, and <i>Principal Tulloch</i>. Her generosity in supporting and
educating the family of a brother as well as her own two sons rendered
necessary a rate of production which was fatal to the permanence of
her work. She was negligent as to style, and often wrote on subjects
to which her intellectual equipment and knowledge did not
enable her to do proper justice. She had, however, considerable
power of painting character, and a vein of humour, and showed untiring
industry in getting up her subjects.</p><br />

by <i>Adeline Mowbray</i> (1804), <i>Temper</i> (1812), <i>Tales from Real Life</i>
(1813), and others, all having the same aim of developing the
virtuous affections, the same merit of natural and vivid painting of
character and passions, and the same fault of a too great preponderance
of the pathetic. They were soon superseded by the more
powerful genius of Scott and Miss Edgeworth. In 1825 she became
a Quaker. After this she wrote <i>Illustrations of Lying</i> (1825), and
<i>Detraction Displayed</i> (1828). Her later years, which were singularly
cheerful, were largely devoted to philanthropic interests.</p><br />

<a name='OTWAY_THOMAS_1651_or_1652_1685'></a><p><b>OTWAY, THOMAS (1651 or 1652-1685).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist, <i>s.</i> of a
clergyman, was <i>b.</i> near Midhurst, Sussex, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., which he
left without graduating. His short life, like those of many of his
fellows, was marked by poverty and misery, and he appears to have
<i>d.</i> practically of starvation. Having failed as an actor, he took to
writing for the stage, and produced various plays, among which <i>Don
Carlos, Prince of Spain</i> (1676), was a great success, and brought him
<a name='Page_292'></a>some money. Those by which he is best remembered, however, are
<i>The Orphan</i> (1680), and <i>Venice Preserved</i> (1682), both of which have
been frequently revived. O. made many adaptations from the
French, and in his tragedy of <i>Caius Marius</i> incorporated large parts
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. He has been called &quot;the most pathetic and
tear-drawing of all our dramatists,&quot; and he excelled in delineating the
stronger passions. The grossness of his comedies has banished them
from the stage. Other plays are <i>The Cheats of Scapin</i>, <i>Friendship
in Fashion</i>, <i>Soldier's Fortune</i> (1681), and <i>The Atheist</i>.</p><br />

&mdash;Humorous poet, was a
Scottish advocate, a friend of Prof. Wilson, and for some time ed. of
the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>. He printed privately in 1851 <i>Lyrics, Legal and
Miscellaneous</i>, which were <i>pub.</i> with a memoir in 1874. Many of his
pieces are highly amusing, the <i>Annuity</i> being the best.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet and miscellaneous
writer, <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., became the friend of Carr, afterwards
Earl of Rochester and Somerset, and fell a victim to a Court intrigue
connected with the proposed marriage of Rochester and Lady Essex,
being poisoned in the Tower with the connivance of the latter. He
wrote a poem, <i>A Wife, now a Widowe</i>, and <i>Characters</i> (1614), short,
witty descriptions of types of men. Some of those <i>pub.</i> along with
his are by other hands.</p><br />

&mdash;Epigrammatist, <i>b.</i> at Plas
Dhu, Carnarvonshire, <i>ed.</i> at Winchester and Oxf., and became head
master of King Henry VIII. School at Warwick. His Latin
epigrams, which have both sense and wit in a high degree, gained
him much applause, and were translated into English, French,
German, and Spanish.</p><br />

<a name='OWEN_JOHN_1616_1683'></a><p><b>OWEN, JOHN (1616-1683).</b>
&mdash;Puritan divine, <i>b.</i> at Stadhampton,
Oxfordshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., from which he was driven by
Laud's statutes. Originally a Presbyterian, he passed over to Independency.
In 1649 he accompanied Cromwell to Ireland, and in
1650 to Edinburgh. He was Dean of Christ Church, Oxf. (1651-60),
and one of the &quot;triers&quot; of ministers appointed by Cromwell. After
the Restoration he was ejected from his deanery, but was favoured
by Clarendon, who endeavoured to induce him to conform to the
Anglican Church by offers of high preferment. Strange to say
Charles II. also held him in regard, and gave him money for the
Nonconformists; and he was allowed to preach to a congregation of
Independents in London. His great learning and ability rendered
him a formidable controversialist, specially against Arminianism
and Romanism. His works fill 28 vols; among the best known being
<i>The Divine Original, etc., of the Scriptures</i>, <i>Indwelling Sin</i>, <i>Christologia,
or ... The Person of Christ</i>, and a commentary on Hebrews.</p><br />

&mdash;Socialist and philanthropist,
<i>b.</i> at Newton, Montgomeryshire, had for his object the
regeneration of the world on the principles of socialism. His sincerity
was shown by the fact that he spent most of the fortune, which
<a name='Page_293'></a>his great capacity for business enabled him to make, in endeavours
to put his theories into practice at various places both in Britain
and America. He was sincerely philanthropic, and incidentally did
good on a considerable scale in the course of his more or less impracticable
schemes. He propounded his ideas in <i>New Views of Society,
or Essays on the Formation of the Human Character</i> (1816).</p><br />

&mdash;Was
a courtier of Queen Elizabeth, who lost his friends by his insolence
and pride, and his fortune by his extravagance. He <i>m.</i> a <i>dau.</i> of
Lord Burghley, who had to support his family after his death. He
had some reputation as a writer of short pieces, many of which are
in the <i>Paradise of Dainty Devices</i>.</p><br />

<a name='PAINE_THOMAS_1737_1809'></a><p><b>PAINE, THOMAS (1737-1809).</b>
&mdash;Political and anti-Christian
writer, <i>s.</i> of a stay-maker and small farmer of Quaker
principles at Thetford, became with large classes perhaps the most
unpopular man in England. After trying various occupations, including
those of schoolmaster and exciseman, and having separated
from his wife, he went in 1774 to America where, in 1776, he <i>pub.</i> his
famous pamphlet, <i>Common Sense</i>, in favour of American independence.
He served in the American army, and also held some
political posts, including that of sec. to a mission to France in 1781.
Returning to England in 1787 he <i>pub.</i> his <i>Rights of Man</i> (1790-92),
in reply to Burke's <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i>. It had an
enormous circulation, 1,500,000 copies having been sold in England
alone; but it made it necessary for him to escape to France to avoid
prosecution. Arrived in that country he was elected to the National
Convention. He opposed the execution of Louis XVI., and was, in
1794, imprisoned by Robespierre, whose fall saved his life. He had
then just completed the first part of his <i>Age of Reason</i>, of which the
other two appeared respectively in 1795 and 1807. It is directed
alike against Christianity and Atheism, and supports Deism. Becoming
disgusted with the course of French politics, he returned to
America in 1802, but found himself largely ostracised by society
there, became embroiled in various controversies, and is said to
have become intemperate. He <i>d.</i> at New York in 1809. Though
apparently sincere in his views, and courageous in the expression of
them, P. was vain and prejudiced. The extraordinary lucidity and
force of his style did much to gain currency for his writings.</p><br />

<a name='PAINTER_WILLIAM_1540_1594'></a><p><b>PAINTER, WILLIAM (1540?-1594).</b>
&mdash;Translator, etc., <i>ed.</i>
at Camb., was then successively schoolmaster at Sevenoaks, and
Clerk of the Ordnance, in which position his intromissions appear to
have been of more advantage to himself than to the public service.
He was the author of <i>The Palace of Pleasure</i> (1566), largely consisting
of translations from Boccaccio, Bandello, and other Italian
writers, and also from the classics. It formed a quarry in which
many dramatists, including Shakespeare, found the plots for their
plays.</p><br />

<a name='PALEY_WILLIAM_1743_1805'></a><p><b>PALEY, WILLIAM (1743-1805).</b>
&mdash;Theologian, <i>s.</i> of a
minor canon of Peterborough, where he was <i>b.</i>, went at 15 as a
sizar to Christ's Coll., Camb., where he was Senior Wrangler, and
<a name='Page_294'></a>became a Fellow and Tutor of his coll. Taking orders in 1767 he
held many benefices, and rose to be Archdeacon of Carlisle, and Sub-Dean
of Lincoln. P., who holds one of the highest places among
English theologians, was the author of four important works&mdash;<i>Principles
of Moral and Political Philosophy</i> (1785), <i>Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;</i>, his
most original, but least popular, book (1790), <i>View of the Evidences
of Christianity</i> (1794), and <i>Natural Theology</i> (1802). Though now to
a large extent superseded, these works had an immense popularity
and influence in their day, and are characterised by singular clearness
of expression and power of apt illustration. The system of
morals inculcated by P. is Utilitarian, modified by theological ideas.
His view of the &quot;divine right of Kings&quot; as on a level with &quot;the
divine right of constables&quot; was unpleasing to George III., notwithstanding
which his ecclesiastical career was eminently successful.
His manners were plain and kindly.</p><br />

<a name='PALGRAVE_SIR_FRANCIS_1788_1861'></a><p><b>PALGRAVE, SIR FRANCIS (1788-1861).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of
Meyer Cohen, a Jewish stockbroker, but at his marriage in 1823,
having previously become a Christian, assumed his mother-in-law's
name of Palgrave. He studied law, and was called to the Bar in
1827. From 1838 until his death in 1861 he was Deputy Keeper of
the Records, and in that capacity arranged a vast mass of hitherto
inaccessible documents, and ed. many of them for the Record Commission.
His historical works include a <i>History of England in Anglo-Saxon
Times</i> (1831), <i>Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth</i>
(1832), and <i>History of Normandy and England</i> (4 vols., 1851-64), <i>pub.</i>
posthumously. He was knighted in 1832. His works are of great
value in throwing light upon the history and condition of medi&aelig;val
England.</p><br />

<a name='PALGRAVE_FRANCIS_TURNER_1824_1897'></a><p><b>PALGRAVE, FRANCIS TURNER (1824-1897).</b>
&mdash;Poet and
critic, <i>s.</i> of the above, <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., was for many years connected
with the Education Department, of which he rose to be Assistant
Sec.; and from 1886-95 he was Prof. of Poetry at Oxf. He
wrote several vols. of poetry, including <i>Visions of England</i> (1881),
and <i>Amenophis</i> (1892), which, though graceful and exhibiting much
poetic feeling, were the work rather of a man of culture than of a
poet. His great contribution to literature was his anthology, <i>The
Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics</i> (1864), selected with marvellous
insight and judgment. A second series showed these qualities in a
less degree. He also <i>pub.</i> an anthology of sacred poetry.</p><br />

<a name='PALTOCK_ROBERT_1697_1767'></a><p><b>PALTOCK, ROBERT (1697-1767).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, was an
attorney, and wrote <i>The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins, a
Cornish Man</i> (1751), admired by Scott, Coleridge, and Lamb. It is
somewhat on the same plan as <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, the special feature
being the <i>gawry</i>, or flying woman, whom the hero discovered on his
island, and married. The description of Nosmnbdsgrutt, the
country of the flying people, is a dull imitation of Swift, and much
else in the book is tedious.</p><br />

<a name='PARDOE_JULIA_1806_1862'></a><p><b>PARDOE, JULIA (1806-1862).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and miscellaneous
writer, <i>b.</i> at Beverley, showed an early bias towards literature, and
became a voluminous and versatile writer, producing in addition to
<a name='Page_295'></a>her lively and well-written novels many books of travel, and others
dealing with historical subjects. She was a keen observer, and her
Oriental travels had given her an accurate and deep knowledge of
the peoples and manners of the East. Among her books are <i>The
City of the Sultan</i> (1836), <i>Romance of the Harem</i>, <i>Thousand and One
Days</i>, <i>Louis XIV. and the Court of France</i>, <i>Court of Francis I.</i>, etc.</p><br />

<a name='PARIS_MATTHEW_c_1195_1259'></a><p><b>PARIS, MATTHEW (<i>c.</i> 1195-1259).</b>
&mdash;Chronicler, entered in
1217 the Benedictine Monastery of St. Albans, and continued the
work of <a href='#WENDOVER_ROGER_DE_d_1236'>Roger de Wendover</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) as chronicler of the monastery.
In 1248 he went on the invitation of Hacon King of Norway to
reform the Abbey of St. Benet Holm. In this he was successful, and
on his return to England enjoyed the favour of Henry III., who
conversed familiarly with him, and imparted information as to
matters of state, which constitutes a valuable element in his histories.
He had a high reputation for piety and learning, was a
patriotic Englishman, and resisted the encroachments of Rome.
His chief work is <i>Historia Major</i>, from the Conquest until 1259. In
it he embodied the <i>Flores Historiarum</i> of his predecessor Roger, and
the original part is a bold and vigorous narrative of the period (1235-59).
He also wrote <i>Historia Minor</i> and <i>Historia Anglorum</i>, a summary
of the events (1200-1250).</p><br />

<a name='PARK_MUNGO_1771_1806'></a><p><b>PARK, MUNGO (1771-1806).</b>
&mdash;Traveller, <i>b.</i> near Selkirk,
studied medicine at Edin. As a surgeon in the mercantile marine
he visited Sumatra, and on his return attracted the attention of
various scientific men by his botanical and zoological investigations.
In 1795 he entered the service of the African Association, and made
a voyage of discovery on the Niger. His adventures were <i>pub.</i> in
<i>Travels in the Interior of Africa</i> (1799), which had great success. He
<i>m.</i> and set up in practice in Peebles; but in 1805 accepted an invitation
by Government to undertake another journey in Africa. From
this he never returned, having perished in a conflict with natives.
His narratives, written in a straightforward and pleasing style, are
among the classics of travel.</p><br />

<a name='PARKER_THEODORE_1810_1860'></a><p><b>PARKER, THEODORE (1810-1860).</b>
&mdash;Theologian, <i>b.</i> at
Lexington, Massachusetts, <i>ed.</i> at Harvard, was an indefatigable
student, and made himself master of many languages. In 1837
he was settled at West Roxbury as a Unitarian minister, but the
development of his views in a rationalistic direction gradually
separated him from the more conservative portion of his co-religionists.
He lectured on theological subjects in Boston in 1841, travelled
in Europe, and in 1845 settled in Boston, where he lectured to large
audiences, and exercised a wide influence. He took a leading part
in the anti-slavery crusade, and specially in resisting the Fugitive
Slave Act. In 1859 his health, which had never been robust, gave
way; he went to Italy in search of restoration, but <i>d.</i> at Florence.
Although he was a powerful theological and social influence, his
writings are not of corresponding importance: it was rather as a
speaker that he influenced his countrymen, and he left no contribution
to literature of much permanent account, though his <i>coll.</i> works
fill 14 vols. Among the most outstanding of his writings are <i>A Discourse
of Matters Pertaining to Religion</i>, and <i>Sermons for the Times</i><a name='Page_296'></a>.</p><br />

<a name='PARKMAN_FRANCIS_1823_1893'></a><p><b>PARKMAN, FRANCIS (1823-1893).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of a
Unitarian minister in Boston, Massachusetts, graduated at Harvard,
and qualified as a lawyer, but never practised, and though hampered
by a state of health which forbade continuous application, and by
partial blindness, devoted himself to the writing of the history of the
conflict between France and England in North America. This he
did in a succession of works&mdash;<i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i> (1851), <i>The
Pioneers of France in the New World</i> (1865), <i>The Jesuits in North
America</i> (1867), <i>La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West</i> (1869),
<i>The Old Regime in Canada</i> (1874), <i>Count Frontenac and New France</i>
(1877), <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i> (1884), and <i>A Half Century of Conflict</i>
(1892). In these the style, at first somewhat turgid, gradually improved,
and became clear and forcible, while retaining its original
vividness. P. spared no labour in collecting and sifting his material,
much of which was gathered in the course of visits to the places
which were the scenes of his narrative, and his books are the most
valuable contribution in existence to the history of the struggle for
Canada and the other French settlements in North America. He
also wrote two novels, which had little success, and a book upon
rose-culture.</p><br />

<a name='PARNELL_THOMAS_1679_1718'></a><p><b>PARNELL, THOMAS (1679-1718).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> and <i>ed.</i> in
Dublin, took orders in 1700, and was Vicar of Finglas and Archdeacon
of Clogher. The death of his young wife in 1706 drove him
into intemperate habits. He was a friend of Swift and Pope, a
contributor to the <i>Spectator</i>, and aided Pope in his translation of the
<i>Iliad</i>. He wrote various isolated poems showing a fine descriptive
touch, of which the most important are <i>The Hermit</i>, <i>The Night
Piece</i>, and <i>The Hymn to Contentment</i>. P. was a scholar, and had
considerable social gifts. His Life was written by Goldsmith.</p><br />

<a name='PARR_DR_SAMUEL_1747_1825'></a><p><b>PARR, DR. SAMUEL (1747-1825).</b>
&mdash;Scholar, <i>s.</i> of an
apothecary at Harrow, where and at Camb. he was <i>ed.</i> He was successively
an assistant-master at Harrow and headmaster of schools
at Colchester and Norwich, and having taken orders, finally settled
down at Hatton, Warwickshire, where he took private pupils. He
was undoubtedly a great Latinist, but he has left no work to account
for the immense reputation for ability which he enjoyed during his
life. His chief power appears to have been in conversation, in
which he was bold, arrogant, and epigrammatic. He was nicknamed
&quot;the Whig Johnson,&quot; but fell very far short of his model.
His writings, including correspondence, were <i>pub.</i> in 8 vols.</p><br />

<a name='PATER_WALTER_HORATIO_1839_1894'></a><p><b>PATER, WALTER HORATIO (1839-1894).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and
critic, <i>s.</i> of Richard G.P., of American birth and Dutch extraction, a
benevolent physician, <i>b.</i> at Shadwell, and <i>ed.</i> at the King's School,
Canterbury, and at Queen's Coll., Oxf., after leaving which he made
various tours in Germany and Italy where, especially in the latter,
his nature, keenly sensitive to every form of beauty, received indelible
impressions. In 1864 he was elected a Fellow of Brasenose,
and in its ancient and austere precincts found his principal home.
As a tutor, though conscientious, he was not eminently successful;
nevertheless his lectures, on which he bestowed much pains, had a
<a name='Page_297'></a>fit audience, and powerfully influenced a few select souls. He resigned
his tutorship in 1880, partly because he found himself not
entirely in his element, and partly because literature was becoming
the predominant interest in his life. In 1885 he went to London,
where he remained for 8 years, continuing, however, to reside at
Brasenose during term. The reputation as a writer which he had
gained made him welcome in whatever intellectual circles he found
himself. Leaving London in 1893 he settled in a house in St. Giles,
Oxf. In the spring of 1894 he went to Glasgow to receive the honorary
degree of LL.D., a distinction which he valued. In the summer
he had an attack of rheumatic fever, followed by pleurisy. From
these he had apparently recovered, but he succumbed to an attack
of heart-failure which immediately supervened. Thus ended prematurely
in its 55th year a life as bare of outward events as it was
rich in literary fruit and influence.</p>

<p>P. is one of the greatest modern masters of style, and one of the
subtlest and most penetrating of critics. Though not a philosopher
in the technical sense, he deeply pondered the subjects with which
philosophy sets itself to deal; but art was the dominating influence
in his intellectual life, and it was said of him that &quot;he was a philosopher
who had gone to Italy by mistake instead of to Germany.&quot;
He may also be called the prophet of the modern &aelig;sthetic school.
His attitude to Christianity, though deeply sceptical, was not unsympathetic.
As a boy he came under the influence of Keble, and
at one time thought of taking orders, but his gradual change of view
led him to relinquish the idea. Among his works may be mentioned
an article on Coleridge, and others on Winckelmann, Leonardo da
Vinci, Michelangelo, Botticelli, etc., which were <i>coll.</i> and <i>pub.</i> as
<i>Studies in the History of the Renaissance</i> (1873); <i>Appreciations</i> (1889)
contained his great essays on <i>&AElig;sthetic Poetry</i> and <i>Style</i>, various
Shakespearian studies and papers on Lamb and Sir T. Browne;
<i>Imaginary Portraits</i>, and <i>Greek Studies</i> (1894); <i>Plato and Platonism</i>
(1893). His masterpiece, however, is <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> (1885),
a philosophical romance of the time of Marcus Aurelius. The style
of P. is characterised by a subdued richness, and complicated, but
perfect structure of sentences. In character he was gentle, refined,
and retiring, with a remarkable suavity of manner and dislike of
controversy.</p><br />

<a name='PATMORE_COVENTRY_KERSEY_DIGHTON_1823_1896'></a><p><b>PATMORE, COVENTRY KERSEY DIGHTON (1823-1896).</b>
&mdash;Poet,
<i>s.</i> of Peter George P., also an author, <i>b.</i> at Woodford, Essex,
was in the printed book department of the British Museum. He
<i>pub.</i> <i>Tamerton Church Tower</i> (1853), and between 1854 and 1862 the
four poems which, combined, form his masterpiece, <i>The Angel in
the House</i>, a poetic celebration of married love. In 1864 he entered
the Church of Rome. Thereafter he <i>pub.</i> <i>The Unknown Eros</i> (1877),
<i>Amelia</i> (1878), and <i>Rod, Root, and Flower</i> (1895), meditations
chiefly on religious subjects. His works are full of graceful and
suggestive thought, but occasionally suffer from length and discursiveness.
He was successful in business matters, and in character
was energetic, masterful, and combative. He numbered Tennyson
and Ruskin among his friends, was associated with the pre-Raphaelites,
and was a contributor to their organ, the <i>Germ</i><a name='Page_298'></a>.</p><br />

<i>b.</i> at Hornby, Yorkshire, <i>s.</i> of a clergyman, <i>ed.</i> privately and at Oxf.,
where in 1839 he became Fellow of Lincoln Coll., and acquired a
high reputation as a tutor and examiner. At first strongly influenced
by Newman and the Tractarian movement, he ultimately
abandoned that school. In 1851, failing to be elected head of his
coll., he threw up his tutorship, and devoted himself to severe study,
occasionally writing on educational subjects in various reviews. In
1861, however, he attained the object of his ambition, being elected
Rector of Lincoln Coll. In 1883 he dictated a remarkable autobiography,
coming down to 1860. In 1875 he had <i>pub.</i> a <i>Life of
Isaac Casaubon</i>, and he left materials for a Life of Scaliger, which
he had intended to be his <i>magnum opus</i>. He also wrote <i>Milton</i> for
the English Men of Letters Series, and produced an ed. of his
sonnets.</p><br />

continuation of which by himself proved a failure. Among his
other writings are <i>John Bull and Brother Jonathan</i> (1812), a satire,

works first appeared; he also ed. the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> 1883-96.
Among his novels&mdash;upwards of 60 in number&mdash;may be mentioned

at various schools, but from the age of 13 self-educated. Nevertheless,
he became a really learned scholar. He was for long in the
India Office, where he rose to be Chief Examiner, coming between
James Mill and John Stuart Mill. He was the author of several
somewhat whimsical, but quite unique novels, full of paradox, prejudice,
and curious learning, with witty dialogue and occasional
poems interspersed. Among them are <i>Headlong Hall</i> (1816), <i>Nightmare
Abbey</i> (1818), <i>Maid Marian</i> (1822), <i>Misfortunes of Elphin</i>

went to Australia, where he remained for 20 years, and was for a time
Minister of Education of Victoria. Returning to England in 1892
<a name='Page_299'></a>he wrote his <i>National Life and Character: a Forecast</i>, in which he
gave utterance to very pessimistic views as to the future of the race.
He also wrote a <i>History of England during the Early and Middle Ages</i>
(1867).</p><br />

<a name='PEARSON_JOHN_1613_1686'></a><p><b>PEARSON, JOHN (1613-1686).</b>
&mdash;Theologian, <i>s.</i> of an archdeacon
of Suffolk, <i>b.</i> at Great Snoring, Norfolk, <i>ed.</i> at Eton and
Camb., took orders, and after holding various preferments, including
the archdeaconry of Surrey, the mastership of Jesus Coll., and of
Trinity Coll., Camb., was made, in 1673, Bishop of Chester. His
<i>Exposition of the Creed</i> (1659) has always been regarded as one of
the most finished productions of English theology, remarkable alike
for logical argument and arrangement, and lucid style. He was
also the author of other learned works, including a defence of the
authenticity of the epistles of Ignatius. In his youth P. was a
Royalist, and acted in 1645 as a chaplain in the Royal army. He
was one of the commissioners in the Savoy Conference.</p><br />

<a name='PECOCK_REGINALD_1395_1460'></a><p><b>PECOCK, REGINALD (1395?-1460?).</b>
&mdash;Theologian, <i>b.</i> in
Wales, entered the Church, and rose to be successively Bishop of St.
Asaph 1444, and of Chichester 1450. He was a strenuous controversialist,
chiefly against the Lollards; but his free style of argument,
and especially his denial of the infallibility of the Church, led
him into trouble, and on being offered the choice of abjuration or
death at the stake, he chose the former, but nevertheless was deprived
of his bishopric, had his books burned, and spent his latter
days in the Abbey of Thorney, Cambridgeshire. His chief work is
<i>The Repressor of overmuch blaming of the Clergy</i> (1455), which, from
its clear, pointed style, remains a monument of 15th century
English. <i>The Book of Faith</i> (1456) is another of his writings.</p><br />

<a name='PEELE_GEORGE_1558_1597'></a><p><b>PEELE, GEORGE (1558?-1597?).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist and poet, <i>s.</i>
of a salter in London, <i>ed.</i> at Christ's Hospital and Oxf., where he had
a reputation as a poet. Coming back to London about 1581 he led
a dissipated life. He appears to have been a player as well as a
playwright, and to have come into possession of some land through
his wife. His works are numerous and consist of plays, pageants,
and miscellaneous verse. His best plays are <i>The Arraignment of
Paris</i> (1584), and <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i> (1594), and among his poems
<i>Polyhymnia</i> (1590), and <i>The Honour of the Garter</i> (1593). Other
works are <i>Old Wives' Tale</i> (1595), and <i>David and Fair Bethsabe</i>
(1599). P. wrote in melodious and flowing blank verse, with
abundance of fancy and brilliant imagery, but his dramas are weak
in construction, and he is often bombastic and extravagant.</p><br />

<a name='PENN_WILLIAM_1644_1718'></a><p><b>PENN, WILLIAM (1644-1718).</b>
&mdash;Quaker apologist, <i>s.</i> of
Sir William P., a celebrated Admiral, was <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i> at
Oxf., where he became a Quaker, and was in consequence expelled
from the Univ. His change of views and his practice of the extremest
social peculiarities imposed by his principles led to a quarrel
with his <i>f.</i>, who is said to have turned him out of doors. Thereafter
he began to write, and one of his books, <i>The Sandy Foundation
Shaken</i> (<i>c.</i> 1668), in which he attacked the doctrines of the Trinity,
the atonement, and justification by faith, led to his being, in 1668,
<a name='Page_300'></a>imprisoned in the Tower, where he wrote his most popular work,
<i>No Cross, No Crown</i> (1668), and a defence of his own conduct, <i>Innocency
with her Open Face</i> (1668), which resulted in his liberation.
Shortly after this, in 1670, on the death of his <i>f.</i>, who had been
reconciled to him, P. succeeded to a fortune, including a claim
against the Government amounting to &pound;15,000, which was ultimately
in 1681 settled by a grant of the territory now forming the state of
Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, however, he had again suffered imprisonment
for preaching, and employed his enforced leisure in
writing four treatises, of which one, <i>The Great Cause of Liberty of
Conscience</i> (<i>c.</i> 1671), is an able defence of religious toleration. In
1682, having obtained the grant above referred to, he set sail for
America, with the view of founding a community based upon the
principles of toleration. Having established a Constitution and set
matters in working order there, P. returned to England in 1684 and
busied himself in efforts for the relief of those Quakers who had
remained at home. The peculiar position of affairs when James II.
was endeavouring to use the Dissenters as a means of gaining concessions
to the Roman Catholics favoured his views, and he was to
some extent successful in his efforts. His connection with the
Court at that time has, however, led to his conduct being severely
animadverted upon by Macaulay and others. In 1690 and for
some time thereafter he was charged with conspiring against the
Revolution Government, but after full investigation was completely
acquitted. His later years were embittered by troubles in Pennsylvania,
and by the dishonesty and ingratitude of an agent by
whose defalcations he was nearly ruined, as a consequence of which
he was imprisoned for debt. He <i>d.</i> soon after his release in 1718.</p><br />

<a name='PENNANT_THOMAS_1726_1798'></a><p><b>PENNANT, THOMAS (1726-1798).</b>
&mdash;Naturalist and
traveller, <i>b.</i> in Flintshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., was one of the most distinguished
naturalists of the 18th century, and <i>pub.</i>, among other
works on natural history, <i>British Zoology</i> (1768), and <i>History of
Quadrupeds</i> (1781). In literature he is, however, best remembered
by his <i>Tours in Scotland</i> (1771-75), which did much to make known
the beauties of the country to England. He also travelled in Ireland
and Wales, and on the Continent, and <i>pub.</i> accounts of his
journeys. Dr. Johnson said of him, &quot;he observes more things than
any one else does.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='PEPYS_SAMUEL_1633_1703'></a><p><b>PEPYS, SAMUEL (1633-1703).</b>
&mdash;Diarist, <i>s.</i> of John P., a London
tailor, but of good family and connected with Sir E. Montague,
afterwards Earl of Sandwich, was <i>ed.</i> at St. Paul's School and at
Camb. After leaving the Univ. he entered the household of Montagu,
who became his life long patron. He held various Government posts,
including that of Surveyor-General of the Victualling Office, in
which he displayed great administrative ability and reforming zeal,
and in 1672 he became Sec. of the Admiralty. After being imprisoned
in the Tower on a charge in connection with the Popish
plot, and deprived of his office, he was in 1686 again appointed Sec.
of the Admiralty, from which, however, he was dismissed at the
Revolution. Thereafter he lived in retirement chiefly at Clapham.
P. was a man of many interests, combining the characters of the
man of business, man of pleasure, and <i>virtuoso</i>, being skilled in
<a name='Page_301'></a>music and a collector of books, manuscripts, and pictures, and he
was Pres. of the Royal Society for two years. He wrote <i>Memoirs of
the Royal Navy</i> (1690), but his great legacy to literature is his
unique and inimitable <i>Diary</i>, begun January 1, 1660, and coming
down to May 31, 1669, when the failure of his sight prevented its
further continuance. As an account by an eye-witness of the
manners of the Court and of society it is invaluable, but it is still
more interesting as, perhaps, the most singular example extant of
unreserved self-revelation&mdash;all the foibles, peccadilloes, and more
serious offences against decorum of the author being set forth with
the most relentless <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and minuteness, it was written in a
cypher or shorthand, which was translated into long-hand by John
Smith in 1825, and ed. by Lord Braybrooke, with considerable excisions.
Later and fuller ed. have followed. P. left his books,
MSS., and collections to Magdalene Coll., Camb., where they are
preserved in a separate library.</p><br />

<a name='PERCIVAL_JAMES_GATES_1795_1854'></a><p><b>PERCIVAL, JAMES GATES (1795-1854).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Berlin,
Conn., was a precocious child, and a morbid and impractical, though
versatile man, with a fatal facility in writing verse on all manner of
subjects and in nearly every known metre. His sentimentalism
appealed to a wide circle, but his was one of the tapers which were
extinguished by Lowell. He had also a reputation as a geologist.
His poetic works include <i>Prometheus</i> and <i>The Dream of a Day</i> (1843).</p><br />

<a name='PERCY_THOMAS_1729_1811'></a><p><b>PERCY, THOMAS (1729-1811).</b>
&mdash;Antiquary and poet, <i>s.</i> of
a grocer at Bridgnorth, where he was <i>b.</i>, <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., entered the
Church, and became in 1778 Dean of Carlisle, and in 1782 Bishop of
Dromore. He <i>pub.</i> various antiquarian works, chiefly with reference
to the North of England; but is best remembered for his great
service to literature in collecting and ed. many ancient ballads, <i>pub.</i>
in 1765 as <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, which did much to bring back
interest in the ancient native literature, and to usher in the revival
of romanticism.</p><br />

<a name='PHILIPS_AMBROSE_1675_1749'></a><p><b>PHILIPS, AMBROSE (1675?-1749).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Shropshire
and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., wrote pastorals and dramas, was one of the Addison
circle, and started a paper, the <i>Freethinker</i>, in imitation of the
<i>Spectator</i>. He also made translations from Pindar and Anacreon,
and a series of short complimentary verses, which gained for him
the nickname of &quot;Namby Pamby.&quot; His <i>Pastorals</i>, though poor
enough, excited the jealousy of Pope, who pursued the unfortunate
author with life-long enmity. P. held various Government appointments
in Ireland.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of an archdeacon of
Salop, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf. His <i>Splendid Shilling</i>, a burlesque in Miltonic
blank verse, still lives, and <i>Cyder</i>, his chief work, an imitation of
Virgil's <i>Georgics</i>, has some fine descriptive passages. P. was also
employed by Harley to write verses on Blenheim as a counterblast
to Addison's <i>Campaign</i>. He <i>d.</i> at 33 of consumption.</p><br />

dying, he was obliged to give up his intention and take to business,
<a name='Page_302'></a>in which, however, he was unsuccessful, and fell into great straits.
He then tried writing, and produced some novels, of which the best
known was <i>Caleb Stukely</i>, which appeared in <i>Blackwood</i> in 1842. He
was latterly a leader-writer for the <i>Times</i>.</p><br />

<a name='PICKEN_ANDREW_1788_1833'></a><p><b>PICKEN, ANDREW (1788-1833).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous writer, <i>b.</i>
in Paisley, was in business in the West Indies, and in Glasgow and
Liverpool, but not being successful, went to London to try his
fortunes in literature. His earlier writings, <i>Tales and Sketches of
the West of Scotland</i> and <i>The Sectarian</i> (1829), gave offence in dissenting
circles: his next, <i>The Dominie's Legacy</i> (1830), had considerable
success, and a book on <i>Travels and Researches of Eminent Missionaries</i>
(1830) did something to rehabilitate him with those whom he
had offended. His last work, <i>The Black Watch</i> (1833), had just
appeared when he <i>d.</i> of an apoplectic seizure. His best work is
somewhat like that of <a href='#GALT_JOHN_1779_1839'>Galt</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p><br />

His now little-remembered poems were chiefly written under the
inspiration of Coleridge and Keats. His chief work, <i>Hymns to the

latter. He also wrote prose sketches.</p><br />

&mdash;Historian and Antiquary,
<i>b.</i> in Edin., was apprenticed to a lawyer, but took to
literature, and produced a number of works distinguished by painstaking
research, but disfigured by a controversial and prejudiced
spirit. His first publication was <i>Select Scottish Ballads</i> (1783), some
of which, however, were composed by himself. A valuable <i>Essay
on Medals</i> (1784) introduced him to Gibbon and Horace Walpole.
Among his other works are <i>Ancient Scottish Poems</i> (1786), <i>Dissertation
on the Goths</i> (1787), <i>Medallic History of England</i> (1790), <i>History
of Scotland</i> (1797), and his best work, <i>Treatise on Rocks</i> (1811). One
of his most inveterate prejudices was against Celts of all tribes and

&mdash;Miscellaneous
writer, <i>m.</i> Henry Thrale, a wealthy brewer, and, after his
death, Gabriel Piozzi, an Italian musician. Her chief distinction is
her friendship with Dr. Johnson, who was for a time almost domesticated
with the Thrales. Her second marriage in the year of Johnson's
death, 1784, broke up the friendship. She wrote <i>Anecdotes of
Dr. Johnson</i>, a work which had a favourable reception, and gives a
lifelike picture of its subject, and left an <i>Autobiography</i>. Her poem,<a name='Page_303'></a>
<i>The Three Warnings</i>, is supposed to have been touched up by
Johnson. Many details of her friendship with J. are given in the

miscellaneous writer, <i>b.</i> in London of Huguenot descent, was in the
Herald Office, and rose to be Somerset Herald, in which capacity he
was repeatedly sent on missions to invest foreign princes with the
Order of the Garter. He produced upwards of 90 adaptations, and
about 70 original pieces for the stage. He also wrote a <i>History of
British Costumes</i>, <i>The Pursuivant of Arms</i> (1852), and <i>The Conqueror
and his Companions</i> (1874), besides autobiographical <i>Recollections</i>
(1872).</p><br />

<a name='POE_EDGAR_ALLAN_1809_1849'></a><p><b>POE, EDGAR ALLAN (1809-1849).</b>
&mdash;Poet and writer of
tales, was <i>b.</i> at Boston, where his parents, who were both actors,
were temporarily living. He was left an orphan in early childhood
in destitute circumstances, but was adopted by a Mr. Allan of Richmond,
Virginia. By him and his wife he was treated with great indulgence,
and in 1815 accompanied them to England, where they
remained for five years, and where he received a good education,
which was continued on their return to America, at the Univ. of
Virginia. He distinguished himself as a student, but got deeply
into debt with gaming, which led to his being removed. In 1829
he <i>pub.</i> a small vol. of poems containing <i>Al Araaf</i> and <i>Tamerlane</i>.
About the same time he proposed to enter the army, and was placed
at the Military Academy at West Point. Here, however, he grossly
neglected his duties, and fell into the habits of intemperance which
proved the ruin of his life, and was in 1831 dismissed. He then
returned to the house of his benefactor, but his conduct was so objectionable
as to lead to a rupture. In the same year P. <i>pub.</i> an enlarged
ed. of his poems, and in 1833 was successful in a competition
for a prize tale and a prize poem, the tale being the <i>MS. found in a
Bottle</i>, and the poem <i>The Coliseum</i>. In the following year Mr. Allan
<i>d.</i> without making any provision for P., and the latter, being now
thrown on his own resources, took to literature as a profession, and
became a contributor to various periodicals. In 1836 he entered
into a marriage with his cousin Virginia Clemm, a very young girl,
who continued devotedly attached to him notwithstanding his many
aberrations, until her death in 1847. <i>The Narrative of Arthur
Gordon Pym</i> appeared in 1838, and in 1839 P. became ed. of the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, in which appeared as <i>Tales of the Arabesque
and Grotesque</i> many of his best stories. In 1845 his famous poem,
<i>The Raven</i>, came out, and in 1848 <i>Eureka, a Prose Poem</i>, a pseudo-scientific
lucubration. The death of his wife gave a severe shock to
his constitution, and a violent drinking bout on a visit to Baltimore
led to his death from brain fever in the hospital there. The literary
output of P., though not great in volume, limited in range, and very
unequal in merit, bears the stamp of an original genius. In his
poetry he sometimes aims at a musical effect to which the sense is
sacrificed, but at times he has a charm and a magic melody all
his own. His better tales are remarkable for their originality and
ingenuity of construction, and in the best of them he rises to a high
level of imagination, as in <i>The House of Usher</i>, while <i>The Gold Beetle</i><a name='Page_304'></a>
or <i>Golden Bug</i> is one of the first examples of the cryptogram story;
and in <i>The Purloined Letters</i>, <i>The Mystery of Marie Roget</i>, and <i>The
Murders in the Rue Morgue</i> he is the pioneer of the modern detective
story.</p>

&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Refrewshire,
studied for the ministry of one of the Scottish Dissenting communions.
After leaving the Univ. of Glasgow he <i>pub.</i> anonymously
<i>Tales of the Covenanters</i>, and in 1827, the year of his untimely death
from consumption, appeared his poem, <i>The Course of Time</i>, which
contains some fine passages, and occasionally faintly recalls Milton
and Young. The poem went through many ed. in Britain and
America. He <i>d.</i> at Shirley, near Southampton, whither he had
gone in search of health.</p><br />

<a name='POMFRET_JOHN_1667_1702'></a><p><b>POMFRET, JOHN (1667-1702).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a clergyman,

the only one remembered, though now never read, is <i>The Choice</i>,
which celebrates a country life free from care, and was highly
popular in its day.</p><br />

<a name='POPE_ALEXANDER_1688_1744'></a><p><b>POPE, ALEXANDER (1688-1744).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i> in London,
of Roman Catholic parentage. His <i>f.</i> was a linen-merchant, who <i>m.</i>
as his second wife Edith Turner, a lady of respectable Yorkshire
family, and of some fortune, made a competence, and retired to a
small property at Binfield, near Windsor. P. received a somewhat
desultory education at various Roman Catholic schools, but after
the age of 12, when he had a severe illness brought on by over-application,
he was practically self-educated. Though never a profound
or accurate scholar, he had a good knowledge of Latin, and a
working acquaintance with Greek. By 1704 he had written a good
deal of verse, which attracted the attention of <a href='#WYCHERLEY_WILLIAM_1640_1716'>Wycherley</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), who
introduced him to town life and to other men of letters. In 1709
his <i>Pastorals</i> were <i>pub.</i> in Tonson's <i>Miscellany</i>, and two years later
<i>The Essay on Criticism</i> appeared, and was praised by Addison. The
<i>Rape of the Lock</i>, which came out in 1714, placed his reputation on
a sure foundation, and thereafter his life was an uninterrupted and
brilliant success. His industry was untiring, and his literary output
almost continuous until his death. In 1713 <i>Windsor Forest</i> (which
won him the friendship of Swift) and <i>The Temple of Fame</i> appeared,
and in 1715 the translation of the <i>Iliad</i> was begun, and the work
<i>pub.</i> at intervals between that year and 1720. It had enormous
popularity, and brought the poet &pound;5000. It was followed by the
<i>Odyssey</i> (1725-26), in which he had the assistance of <a href='#BROOME_WILLIAM_1689_1745'>Broome</a> and
<a href='#FENTON_ELIJAH_1683_1730'>Fenton</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), who, especially the former, caught his style so exactly
as almost to defy identification. It also was highly popular, and
increased his gains to about &pound;8000, which placed him in a position
of independence. While engaged upon these he removed to Chiswick,
where he lived 1716-18, and where he issued in 1717 a <i>coll.</i> ed.
of his works, including the <i>Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady</i> and the
<i>Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard</i>. In 1718, his <i>f.</i> having <i>d.</i>, he again
removed with his mother to his famous villa at Twickenham, the
<a name='Page_305'></a>adornment of the grounds of which became one of his chief interests,
and where, now the acknowledged chief of his art, he received the
visits of his friends, who included the most distinguished men of
letters, wits, statesmen, and beauties of the day. His next task was
his ed. of Shakespeare (1725), a work for which he was not well qualified,
though the preface is a fine piece of prose. The <i>Miscellanies</i>,
the joint work of Pope and Swift, were <i>pub.</i> in 1727-28, and drew
down upon the authors a storm of angry comment, which in turn led
to the production of <i>The Dunciad</i>, first <i>pub.</i> in 1728, and again with
new matter in 1729, an additional book&mdash;the fourth&mdash;being added
in 1742. In it he satirised with a wit, always keen and biting, often
savage and unfair, the small wits and poetasters, and some of a
quite different quality, who had, or whom he supposed to have,
injured him. Between 1731 and 1735 he produced his <i>Epistles</i>, the
last of which, addressed to Arbuthnot, is also known as the <i>Prologue
to the Satires</i>, and contains his ungrateful character of Addison
under the name of &quot;Atticus;&quot; and also, 1733, the <i>Essay on Man</i>, written under the influence of Bolingbroke. His last, and in some
respects best, works were his <i>Imitations of Horace</i>, <i>pub.</i> between
1733 and 1739, and the fourth book of <i>The Dunciad</i> (1742), already
mentioned. A naturally delicate constitution, a deformed body,
extreme sensitiveness, over-excitement, and overwork did not
promise a long life, and P. <i>d.</i> on May 30, 1744, aged 56.</p>

<p>His position as a poet has been the subject of much contention
among critics, and on the whole is lower than that assigned him by
his contemporaries and immediate successors. Of the higher poetic
qualities, imagination, sympathy, insight, and pathos, he had no
great share; but for the work which in his original writings, as distinguished
from translations, he set himself to do, his equipment
was supreme, and the medium which he used&mdash;the heroic couplet&mdash;he
brought to the highest technical perfection of which it is capable.
He wrote for his own age, and in temper and intellectual and spiritual
outlook, such as it was, he exactly reflected and interpreted it. In
the forging of condensed, pointed, and sparkling maxims of life and
criticism he has no equal, and in painting a portrait Dryden alone
is his rival; while in the <i>Rape of the Lock</i> he has produced the best
mock-heroic poem in existence. Almost no author except Shakespeare
is so often quoted. His extreme vanity and sensitiveness to
criticism made him often vindictive, unjust, and venomous. They
led him also into frequent quarrels, and lost him many friends, including
Lady M. Wortley Montagu, and along with a strong tendency
to finesse and stratagem, of which the circumstances attending the
publication of his literary correspondence is the chief instance, make
his character on the whole an unamiable one. On the other hand,
he was often generous; he retained the friendship of such men as
Swift and Arbuthnot, and he was a most dutiful and affectionate son.</p>

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a clergyman
in Berks, <i>ed.</i> at Merchant Taylor's School, studied law at Lincoln's
Inn, and made various translations, wrote some poems, two
tragedies, <i>Herod and Mariamne</i> (1673), and <i>The Siege of Babylon</i>
(1678), and a romance, <i>Eliana</i>. He is best known by his <i>Azaria
and Hushai</i> (1682), in reply to Dryden's <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>,
distinguished from the other replies by its moderation and freedom
from scurrility.</p><br />

<a name='PORSON_RICHARD_1759_1808'></a><p><b>PORSON, RICHARD (1759-1808).</b>
&mdash;Scholar, <i>s.</i> of the parish
clerk of E. Ruston, Norfolk, was distinguished from childhood by a
marvellous tenacity of memory which attracted the attention of the
curate of the parish, who <i>ed.</i> him, after which he was sent by a
gentleman to Eton. Subsequently a fund was collected for the purpose
of maintaining him at Camb., where he had a brilliant career,
and became a Fellow of Trinity Coll. This position he lost by refusing
to take orders. In 1792 he was appointed Prof. of Greek in
the Univ., but resided for the most part in London, where he was
much courted by literary men, but unfortunately fell into extremely
intemperate habits. P. was one of the very greatest of Greek scholars
and critics; but he has left little permanent work of his own. He ed.
four plays of Euripides, viz., <i>Hecuba, Orestes, Ph&oelig;niss&aelig;</i>, and <i>Medea</i>.
His most widely read work was his <i>Letters</i> to Archdeacon Travis on
the disputed passage, 1 John v. 7, which is considered a masterpiece
of acute reasoning. He is buried in the chapel of Trinity Coll.</p><br />

&mdash;Novelists,
were the <i>dau.</i> of an Irish army surgeon, and
sisters of Sir Robert Ker P., the painter and traveller. After the
death of the <i>f.</i> the family settled in Edin., where they enjoyed the
friendship of Scott. ANNA at the age of 12 <i>pub.</i> <i>Artless Tales</i>, the
precursor of a series of tales and novels numbering about 50, the best
being <i>Don Sebastian</i> (1809). JANE, though the elder by four years,
did not <i>pub.</i> until 1803, when her first novel, <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i>,
appeared. <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i> followed in 1810. Both of these
works, especially the latter, had remarkable popularity, the <i>Chiefs</i>
being translated into German and Russian. She had greater talent
than her sister, but like her, while possessed of considerable animation
and imagination, failed in grasping character, and imparting
local verisimilitude. Both were amiable and excellent women. A
romance, <i>Sir Edward Seaward's Diary</i> (1831), purporting to be a
record of actual circumstances, and ed. by Jane, is generally believed
to have been written by a brother, Dr. William Ogilvie P.</p><br />

&mdash;Historian, <i>ed.</i>
at Rugby and Oxf., called to the Bar at the Middle Temple 1874,
became an ardent student of history, and succeeded Froude as Prof.
of Modern History at Oxf. in 1894. Absorbed in study, he wrote
less than his wide and deep learning qualified him for. Among his
works are <i>A History of England to</i> 1509, and he also wrote on Early
England up to the Conquest, and on Alfred and William the
Conqueror<a name='Page_307'></a>.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of
a sergeant-at-law, was <i>b.</i> in London, <i>ed.</i> at Eton and Camb., and
called to the Bar 1829. He sat in Parliament for various places, and
was Sec. to the Board of Control 1834-35. He appeared to have a
brilliant career before him, when his health gave way, and he <i>d.</i> of
consumption in 1839. His poems, chiefly bright and witty skits and
satirical pieces, were <i>pub.</i> first in America 1844, and appeared in
England with a memoir by Derwent Coleridge in 1864. His essays
appeared in 1887.</p><br />

<a name='PRESCOTT_WILLIAM_HICKLING_1796_1859'></a><p><b>PRESCOTT, WILLIAM HICKLING (1796-1859).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
<i>b.</i> at Salem, Massachusetts, the <i>s.</i> of an eminent lawyer, was <i>ed.</i> at
Harvard, where he graduated in 1814. While there he met with an
accident to one of his eyes which seriously affected his sight for the
remainder of his life. He made an extended tour in Europe, and
on his return to America he <i>m.</i>, and abandoning the idea of a legal
career, resolved to devote himself to literature. After ten years of
study, he <i>pub.</i> in 1837 his <i>History of Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, which
at once gained for him a high place among historians. It was
followed in 1843 by the <i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i>, and in 1847
by the <i>Conquest of Peru</i>. His last work was the <i>History of Philip II.</i>,
of which the third vol. appeared in 1858, and which was left unfinished.
In that year he had an apoplectic shock, and another in
1859 was the cause of his death, which took place on January 28 in
the last-named year. In all his works he displayed great research,
impartiality, and an admirable narrative power. The great disadvantage
at which, owing to his very imperfect vision, he worked,
makes the first of these qualities specially remarkable, for his
authorities in a foreign tongue were read to him, while he had to
write on a frame for the blind. P. was a man of amiable and benevolent
character, and enjoyed the friendship of many of the most distinguished
men in Europe as well as in America.</p><br />

<a name='PRICE_RICHARD_1723_1791'></a><p><b>PRICE, RICHARD (1723-1791).</b>
&mdash;Writer on morals, politics,
and economics, <i>s.</i> of a dissenting minister, was <i>b.</i> at Tynton in
Wales, <i>ed.</i> at a dissenting coll. in London, and was then for some
years chaplain to a Mr. Streatfield, who left him some property.
Thereafter he officiated as minister to various congregations near
London. In 1758 his <i>Review of the Principal Questions and Difficulties
in Morals</i>, a work of considerable metaphysical power, appeared;
and it was followed in 1766 by a treatise on <i>The Importance
of Christianity</i>. In 1769 his work on <i>Reversionary Payments</i> was
<i>pub.</i>, and his Northampton Mortality Table was about the same
time constructed. These, though long superseded, were in their day
most valuable contributions to economical science. His most
popular work, <i>Observations on Civil Liberty and the Justice and
Policy of the War with America</i>, appeared in 1776, had an enormous
sale, and led to his being invited to go to America and assist in
establishing the financial system of the new Government. This he
declined chiefly on the score of age. Simplicity, uprightness, and
toleration of opinions opposed to his own appear to have been
marked traits in his character.</p><br />

Westminster School and at Oxf. He first attracted notice by his
description of the Arundel Marbles (1676), which gained for him
powerful patrons, and he rose to be Dean of Norwich. Among his
other works are a <i>Life of Mahomet</i> (1697), and <i>The Old and New
Testament connected in the History of the Jews and Neighbouring
Nations</i> (1715-17), long an important work, of which many ed. were
brought out.</p><br />

&mdash;Chemist, theologian,
and political writer, <i>s.</i> of a draper at Fieldhead, Yorkshire, where he
was <i>b.</i> Brought up as a Calvinist, he gradually became a modified
Unitarian, and after attending a dissenting academy at Daventry,
he became minister to various congregations. About 1756 he <i>pub.</i>
<i>The Scripture Doctrine of Remission</i>, denying the doctrine of atonement,
and in 1761 succeeded Dr. Aiken as teacher of languages and
<i>belles-lettres</i> in the dissenting academy at Warrington. About the
same time he became acquainted with <a href='#FRANKLIN_BENJAMIN_1706_1790'>Franklin</a> and <a href='#PRICE_RICHARD_1723_1791'>Dr. Price</a> (<i>q.v.</i>),
and began to devote himself to science, the fruits of which were his
<i>History and Present State of Electricity</i> (1767), and <i>Vision, Light, and
Colours</i>. He also became a distinguished chemist, and made important
discoveries, including that of oxygen. In 1773 he travelled
on the Continent as companion to Lord Shelburne, where he was introduced
to many men of scientific and literary eminence, by some
of whom he was rallied upon his belief in Christianity. In reply to
this he wrote <i>Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever</i> (1774), and in
answer to the accusations of Atheism brought against him at home,
he <i>pub.</i> (1777) <i>Disquisition relating to Matter and Spirit</i>. In 1780
he settled in Birmingham, in 1782 <i>pub.</i> his <i>Corruptions of Christianity</i>,
and in 1786 his <i>History of Early Opinions concerning Jesus
Christ</i>. He was one of those who wrote replies to Burke's <i>Reflections
on the French Revolution</i>, one consequence of which was his election
as a French citizen, and another the destruction of his chapel, house,
papers, and instruments by a mob. Some years later he went to
America, where he <i>d.</i> P. has been called the father of modern
chemistry. He received many scientific and academic honours,
being a member of the Royal Society, of the Academies of France,
and of St. Petersburg, and an LL.D. of Edin. He was a man of
powerful and original mind, of high character, and of undaunted
courage in maintaining his opinions, which were usually unpopular.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Roxburghshire,
studied at Edin., and became known to Scott, by whose influence
he obtained a grant of land in South Africa, to which he,
with his <i>f.</i> and brothers, emigrated. He took to literary work in
Cape Town, and conducted two papers, which were suppressed for
their free criticisms of the Colonial Government. Thereupon he
returned and settled in London, where he <i>pub.</i> <i>African Sketches</i>.
He also produced a book of poems, <i>Ephemerides</i>.</p><br />

<a name='PRIOR_MATTHEW_1664_1721'></a><p><b>PRIOR, MATTHEW (1664-1721).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> near Wimborne
Minster, Dorset, <i>s.</i> of a joiner who, having <i>d.</i>, he was <i>ed.</i> by an uncle,
and sent to Westminster School. Befriended by the Earl of Dorset
he proceeded to Camb., and while there wrote, jointly with Charles
Montague, <i>The Town and Country Mouse</i>, a burlesque of Dryden's<a name='Page_309'></a>
<i>Hind and Panther</i>. After holding various diplomatic posts, in
which he showed ability and discretion, he entered Parliament in
1700, and, deserting the Whigs, joined the Tories, by whom he was
employed in various capacities, including that of Ambassador at
Paris. On the death of Queen Anne he was recalled, and in 1715
imprisoned, but after two years released. In 1719 a folio ed. of his
works was brought out, by which he realised &pound;4000, and Lord Harley
having presented him with an equal sum, he looked forward to the
peace and comfort which were his chief ambition. He did not, however,
long enjoy his prosperity, dying two years later. Among his
poems may be mentioned <i>Solomon</i>, which he considered his best
work, <i>Alma, or the Progress of the Mind</i>, <i>The Female Phaeton</i>, <i>To a
Child of Quality</i>, and some prose tales. His chief characteristic is
a certain elegance and easy grace, in which he is perhaps unrivalled.
His character appears to have been by no means unimpeachable, but
he was amiable and free from any trace of vindictiveness.</p><br />

the title of <i>Legends and Lyrics</i> (1858), of which many ed. appeared.
In 1851 Miss P. became a Roman Catholic. She took much interest
in social questions affecting women. She wrote the well-known
songs, <i>Cleansing Fires</i> and <i>The Lost Chord</i>, and among her many
hymns are, <i>I do not ask, O Lord, that Life may be</i>, and <i>My God, I

practised successfully as a solicitor. Thereafter he became a barrister,
and was, 1832-61, a Commissioner of Lunacy. By 1823 he
had produced four vols. of poetry and a tragedy, <i>Mirandola</i> (1821).
His works include <i>Dramatic Scenes</i> (1819), <i>A Sicilian Story</i>, <i>Marcian
Colonna</i> (1820), <i>The Flood of Thessaly</i> (1823), and <i>English Songs</i>
(1832), which last will perhaps survive his other writings. P. was

&mdash;Controversial writer, <i>b.</i>
near Bath, <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., studied law at Lincoln's Inn, of which he
became a bencher, but soon became immersed in the writing of
controversial pamphlets. After the <i>Unloveliness of Lovelocks</i> and
<i>Health's Sicknesse</i> (1627-30) appeared his best known controversial
work, <i>Histrio-Mastix</i>, or a <i>Scourge for Stage Players</i> (1633), a bitter
attack on most of the popular amusements of the day. It was
punished with inhuman severity. P. was brought before the Star
Chamber, fined &pound;5000, pilloried, and had both his ears cut off.
Undeterred by this he issued from his prison a fierce attack upon
Laud and the hierarchy, for which he was again fined, pilloried, and
branded on both cheeks with the letters S.L. (seditious libeller).
Removed to Carnarvon Castle he remained there until liberated in
1641 by the Long Parliament. He soon after became a member of
the House, and joined with extreme, but not inexcusable, rancour
<a name='Page_310'></a>in the prosecution of Laud. After this he turned his attention to
the Independents, whom he hated scarcely less than the Prelatists,
and was among those expelled from the House of Commons by
Cromwell, whom he had opposed in regard to the execution of the
King with such asperity that he again suffered imprisonment, from
which he was released in 1652. He supported the Restoration, and
was by Charles II. appointed Keeper of the Records in the Tower.
Here he did good service by compiling the <i>Calendar of Parliamentary
Writs</i> and <i>Records</i>. He <i>pub.</i> in all about 200 books and pamphlets.</p><br />

<a name='PSALMANAZAR_GEORGE_1679_1763'></a><p><b>PSALMANAZAR, GEORGE (1679?-1763).</b>
&mdash;Literary impostor.
His real name is unknown. He is believed to have been a
native of France or Switzerland, but represented himself as a native
of the island of Formosa, and palmed off a Formosan language of his
own construction, to which he afterwards added a description of the
island. For a time he was in the military service of the Duke of
Mecklenburg, and formed a connection with William Innes, chaplain
of a Scottish regiment, who collaborated with him in his frauds, and
introduced various refinements into his methods. Innes, however,
was appointed chaplain to the forces in Portugal, and P. was unable
to maintain his impositions, and was exposed. After a serious illness
in 1728 he turned over a new leaf and became a respectable and
efficient literary hack; his works in his latter days included a
<i>General History of Printing</i>, contributions to the <i>Universal History</i>,
and an <i>Autobiography</i> containing an account of his impostures.</p><br />

including the rectory of St. Martin's, Ludgate Hill. The papers of
<a href='#HAKLUYT_RICHARD_1553_1616'>R. Hakluyt</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) came into his hands, and he made several compilations
relating to man, his nature, doings, and surroundings.
His three works are (1) <i>Purchas his Pilgrimage, or Relations of the
World and the Religions observed in all Ages and Places, etc.</i>; (2)
<i>Purchas his Pilgrim, Microcosmus, or the History of Man, etc.</i>; and
(3) <i>Hakluytus Posthumus, or Purchas his Pilgrimes, containing a History
of the World in Sea Voyages and Land Travels, etc.</i> Although
credulous, diffuse, and confused, these works have preserved many
interesting and curious matters which would otherwise have been lost.</p><br />

<a name='PUSEY_EDWARD_BOUVERIE_1800_1882'></a><p><b>PUSEY, EDWARD BOUVERIE (1800-1882).</b>
&mdash;Scholar and
theologian, <i>b.</i> at Pusey, Berks, <i>ed.</i> at Eton and Oxf., belonged to the
family of Lord Folkstone, whose name was Bouverie, his <i>f.</i> assuming
that of P. on inheriting certain estates. After studying
in Germany, he became in 1828 Regius Prof. of Hebrew at Oxf.
His first important work was an <i>Essay on the Causes of Rationalism
in German Theology</i>, and the arrest of similar tendencies in England
became one of the leading objects of his life. He was one of the
chief leaders of the Tractarian movement, and contributed tracts on
<i>Baptism</i> and on <i>Fasting</i>. In consequence of a sermon on the
Eucharist, he was in 1843 suspended from the office of Univ.
Preacher which he then held. Later writings related to <i>Confession</i>
and <i>The Doctrine of the Real Presence</i>, and in 1865 he issued an
<i>Eirenicon</i> in support of union with the Church of Rome. He was
prominent in all movements and controversies affecting the Univ.,
<a name='Page_311'></a>and was foremost among the prosecutors of <a href='#JOWETT_BENJAMIN_1817_1893'>Jowett</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). Among
his other literary labours are commentaries on Daniel and the minor
Prophets, a treatise on Everlasting Punishment, and a Catalogue of
the Arabic MS. in the Bodleian Library.</p><br />

&mdash;Was one of the <i>s.</i>

him the authorship of <i>The Arte of Poesie</i>, a treatise of some length
divided into three parts, (1) of poets and poesy, (2) of proportion,
(3) of ornament. It is now thought rather more likely that it was
written by his brother RICHARD (1520?-1601). George was the
author of an <i>Apologie</i> for Queen Elizabeth's treatment of Mary
Queen of Scots.</p><br />

from 1790. In the last capacity he wrote official poems of ludicrous
dulness, and was generally a jest and a byword in literary circles.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at the manor-house
of Stewards near Romford, was at Camb., and studied law at
Lincoln's Inn. Thereafter he went to the Continent, and at Heidelberg
acted as cup-bearer to Elizabeth of Bohemia, <i>dau.</i> of James I.
He next appears as sec. to Archbishop Ussher in Ireland, and was in
1639 Chronologer to the City of London. On the outbreak of the
Civil War he sided with the Royalists, and was plundered by the
Parliamentarians of his books and rare manuscripts, which is said to
have so grieved him as to bring about his death. His first book of
poems was <i>A Feast for Worms</i> (1620); others were <i>Hadassa</i> (Esther)
(1621), <i>Sion's Elegies</i> (1625), and <i>Divine Emblems</i> (1635), by far his
most popular book. His style was that fashionable in his day,
affected, artificial, and full of &quot;conceits,&quot; but he had both real
poetical fire and genuine wit, mixed with much that was false in
taste, and though quaint and crabbed, is seldom feeble or dull. He
was twice <i>m.</i>, and had by his first wife 18 children.</p><br />

<a name='RADCLIFFE_MRS_ANN_WARD_1764_1823'></a><p><b>RADCLIFFE, MRS. ANN (WARD) (1764-1823).</b>
&mdash;Novelist,
only <i>dau.</i> of parents in a respectable position, in 1787 <i>m.</i> Mr. William
Radcliffe, ed. and proprietor of a weekly newspaper, the <i>English
Chronicle</i>. In 1789 she <i>pub.</i> her first novel, <i>The Castles of Athlin and
Dunbayne</i>, of which the scene is laid in Scotland. It, however, gave
little promise of the future power of the author. In the following
year appeared <i>The Sicilian Romance</i>, which attracted attention by
its vivid descriptions and startling incidents. Next came <i>The
Romance of the Forest</i> (1791), followed by <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>
(1794), and <i>The Italian</i> (1797), a story of the Inquisition, the last of
her works <i>pub.</i> during her life-time. <i>Gaston de Blondeville</i>, ed. by
Sergeant Talfourd, was brought out posthumously. Mrs. R. has
been called the Salvator Rosa of British novelists. She excels in the
description of scenes of mystery and terror whether of natural
scenery or incident: in the former displaying a high degree of imaginative
power, and in the latter great ingenuity and fertility of invention.
She had, however, little power of delineating character.
Though her works belong to a type now out of fashion, they will
<a name='Page_312'></a>always possess an historical interest as marking a stage in the
development of English fiction.</p><br />

<a name='RALEIGH_SIR_WALTER_1552_1618'></a><p><b>RALEIGH, SIR WALTER (1552?-1618).</b>
&mdash;Explorer, statesman,
admiral, historian, and poet, <i>s.</i> of Walter R., of Fardel, Devonshire,
was <i>b.</i> at Hayes Barton in that county. In 1568 he was sent
to Oxf., where he greatly distinguished himself. In the next year
he began his career of adventure by going to France as a volunteer
in aid of the Huguenots, serving thereafter in the Low Countries.
The year 1579 saw him engaged in his first voyage of adventure in
conjunction with his half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert. Their
object was to discover and settle lands in North America; but the
expedition failed, chiefly owing to opposition by the Spaniards.
The next year he was fighting against the rebels in Ireland; and
shortly thereafter attracted the notice of Queen Elizabeth, in whose
favour he rapidly rose. In 1584 he fitted out a new colonising expedition
to North America, and succeeded in discovering and occupying
Virginia, named after the Queen. On his return he was knighted.
In the dark and anxious days of the Armada, 1587-88, R. was employed
in organising resistance, and rendered distinguished service
in action. His favour with the Queen, and his haughty bearing,
had, however, been raising up enemies and rivals, and his intrigue
and private marriage with Elizabeth Throckmorton, one of the
maids of honour, in 1593, lost him for a time the favour of the Queen.
Driven from the Court he returned to the schemes of adventure
which had so great a charm for him, and fired by the Spanish
accounts of the fabulous wealth of Guiana, he and some of his
friends fitted out an expedition which, however, though attended
with various brilliant episodes, proved unsuccessful. Restored to
the favour of the Queen, he was appointed an Admiral in the expeditions
to Cadiz, 1596, and in the following year was engaged in an
attack on the Azores, in both of which he added greatly to his reputation.
The death of Elizabeth in 1603 was the turning point in
R.'s fortunes. Thenceforward disaster clouded his days. The new
sovereign and his old enemies combined to compass his ruin. Accused
of conspiring against the former he was, against all evidence,
sentenced to death, and though this was not at the time carried out,
he was imprisoned in the Tower and his estates confiscated. During
this confinement he composed his <i>History of the World</i>, which he
brought down to 130 B.C. It is one of the finest specimens of Elizabethan
prose, reflective in matter and dignified and grave in style.
Released in 1615 he set out on his last voyage, again to Guiana,
which, like the former, proved a failure, and in which he lost his

pity from his ungenerous King who, urged, it is believed, by the King
of Spain, had him beheaded on Tower Hill, October 29, 1618. R. is
one of the most striking and brilliant figures in an age crowded with
great men. Of a noble presence, he was possessed of a commanding
intellect and a versatility which enabled him to shine in every enterprise
to which he set himself. In addition to his great fragment the<a name='Page_313'></a>
<i>History of the World</i>, he wrote <i>A Report of the Truth of the Fight
about the Azores</i>, and <i>The Discoverie of the Empire of Guiana</i>, besides
various poems chiefly of a philosophic cast, of which perhaps the
best known are <i>The Pilgrimage</i>, and that beginning &quot;Go, Soul, the

<a name='RAMSAY_ALLAN_1686_1758'></a><p><b>RAMSAY, ALLAN (1686-1758).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a mine-manager
at Leadhills, Dumfriesshire, who claimed kin with the
Ramsays of Dalhousie. In his infancy he lost his <i>f.</i>, and his mother <i>m.</i>
a small &quot;laird,&quot; who gave him the ordinary parish school education.
In 1701 he came to Edinburgh as apprentice to a wig-maker, took
to writing poetry, became a member of the &quot;Easy Club,&quot; of which
Pitcairn and Ruddiman, the grammarian, were members, and of which
he was made &quot;laureate.&quot; The club <i>pub.</i> his poems as they were
thrown off, and their appearance soon began to be awaited with
interest. In 1716 he <i>pub.</i> an additional canto to <i>Christ's Kirk on the
Green</i>, a humorous poem sometimes attributed to James I., and in
1719 he became a bookseller, his shop being a meeting-place of the
<i>literati</i> of the city. A <i>coll.</i> ed. of his poems appeared in 1720, among
the subscribers to which were Pope, Steele, Arbuthnot, and Gay.
It was followed by <i>Fables and Tales</i>, and other poems. In 1724 he
began the <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>, a collection of new Scots songs set
to old melodies, and the <i>Evergreen</i>, a collection of old Scots poems
with which R. as ed. took great liberties. This was a kind of work
for which he was not qualified, and in which he was far from successful.
<i>The Gentle Shepherd</i>, by far his best known and most meritorious
work, appeared in 1725, and had an immediate popularity
which, to a certain extent, it retains. It is a pastoral drama, and
abounds in character, unaffected sentiment, and vivid description.
After this success R., satisfied with his reputation, produced nothing,
more of importance. He was the first to introduce the circulating
library into Scotland, and among his other enterprises was an unsuccessful
attempt to establish a theatre in Edin. On the whole his
life was a happy and successful one, and he had the advantage of a
cheerful, sanguine, and contented spirit. His foible was an innocent
and good-natured vanity.</p><br />

literary career with some dramas, of which the most remarkable
were <i>Masks and Faces</i>, <i>Gold</i>, and <i>Drink</i>. He afterwards rewrote the
first of these as a novel, <i>Peg Woffington</i> (1852), which attained great
popularity. <i>It is never too late to Mend</i> appeared in 1856, his historical
novel, <i>The Cloister and the Hearth</i>, generally regarded as his
masterpiece (1861), <i>Hard Cash</i> (1863), <i>Griffith Gaunt</i> (1867), <i>Foul
Play</i> (1869), <i>Put Yourself in his Place</i> (1870), and <i>A Terrible Temptation</i>
(1871). Critics have differed very widely as to the merits of
R. as a novelist, and have attributed to, and denied him the same
qualities; but it will be generally admitted that, while very
unequal, he was at his best a writer of unusual power and vividness.
Nearly all are agreed as to the great excellence of <i>The Cloister
and the Hearth</i>, Mr. Swinburne placing it &quot;among the very greatest
masterpieces of narrative.&quot; Many of his novels were written with
a view to the reformation of some abuse. Thus <i>Hard Cash</i> exposes
certain private asylums, and <i>Foul Play</i>, written in collaboration
with Dion Boucicault, is levelled against ship-knackers.</p><br />

Four years later he became one of the Prof. of Philosophy (including
mathematics and natural philosophy) in King's Coll., Aberdeen, and

Philosophy in Glasgow. In the following year he <i>pub.</i> his great
work, <i>Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common
Sense</i>, directed against Hume's <i>Essay on Human Nature</i>. Up to
the appearance of the latter work in 1739 R. had been a follower of
Berkeley, but the conclusions drawn therein from the idealistic
philosophy led him to revise his theories, and to propound what is
usually known as the &quot;common sense&quot; philosophy, by which term
is meant the beliefs common to rational beings as such. In 1785 he
<i>pub.</i> his <i>Essay on the Intellectual Powers</i>, which was followed in 1788
by that <i>On the Active Powers</i>. R., who, though below the middle
size, was strong and fond of exercise, maintained his bodily and
mental vigour until his death at 86. His writings, distinguished by
logical rigour of method and clearness of style, exercised a profound
influence in France as well as at home; but his attempted refutation
of Berkeley is now generally considered to have failed.</p>

but means failed, and at the age of 17 he went to London, and was
apprenticed to a printer. Careful and diligent, he prospered in
business, became printer of the Journals of the House of Commons,
and in the year before his death purchased the moiety of the patent
of King's Printer. He was twice <i>m.</i>, and each of his wives brought
<a name='Page_318'></a>him six children, of whom, however, only four daughters were living
at his death. R., who was the originator of the modern novel, did
not take seriously to literature until he was past 50 when, in 1740,
<i>Pamela</i> appeared. It originated in a proposal by two printers that
R. should write a collection of model letters for the use of persons
unaccustomed to correspondence, but it soon developed in his hands
into a novel in which the story is carried on in the form of a correspondence.
With faults and absurdities, it struck a true note of
sentiment, and exploded the prevalent idea that dukes and princesses
were the only suitable heroes and heroines (Pamela was a
maid-servant), and it won immediate and phenomenal popularity.
In 1748 <i>Clarissa Harlow</i>, his masterpiece, was <i>pub.</i>, and in 1753 <i>Sir
Charles Grandison</i>, in which the author embodies his ideal of a
Christian gentleman. All these surfer from an elaboration of detail
which often becomes tedious; but in deep acquaintance with the
motives of conduct, and especially of the workings of the female
heart, they are almost unrivalled; their pathos also is genuine and
deep. R. had an unusual faculty as the platonic friend and counsellor
of women, and was the centre of an admiring circle of the sex,
who ministered to a vanity which became somewhat excessive. R.
has also the distinction of evoking the genius of Fielding, whose
first novel, <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, was begun as a skit or parody upon
<i>Pamela</i>. R. is described as &quot;a stout, rosy, vain, prosy little man.&quot;

showed his loyalty by offering himself to Sir J. Cope as a volunteer,
a service which was, however, declined. He soon began to take a
prominent part in the debates of the General Assembly, of which he
rose to be the undisputed leader. In 1758 he became one of the
city ministers of Edin., and in the following year <i>pub.</i> his <i>History of

the society of his friends, among whom were most of his distinguished
contemporaries. As a writer he possessed a finished style,
clear, measured, and stately, which carried his well-arranged narrative
as on a full and steady stream; he was also cool and sagacious
but, like Hume, he was apt to take his facts at second hand, and the
vast additional material which has been in course of accumulation
since his day has rendered the value of his work more and more
literary, and less and less historical.</p>

Between 1800 and 1805 he studied at various places in Germany,
and became acquainted with nearly all the great men of letters there,
including Goethe, Schiller, Herder, Wieland, etc. Thereafter he
became war correspondent to the <i>Times</i> in the Peninsula. On his
return to London he studied for the Bar, to which he was called in
1813, and became leader of the Eastern Circuit. Fifteen years later
he retired, and by virtue of his great conversational powers and
other qualities, became a leader in society, going everywhere and
knowing everybody worth knowing. He <i>d.</i> unmarried, aged 91, and

&mdash;Poet,
<i>s.</i> of the 1st Earl, <i>b.</i> at Ditchley in Oxfordshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf.,
saw some naval service when he showed conspicuous bravery. He
became one of the most dissolute of the courtiers of Charles II., and
wore himself out at 33 by his wild life. He was handsome, and witty,
and possessed a singular charm of manner. He wrote a number of
light, graceful poems, many of them extremely gross. Bishop
Burnet, who attended him on his deathbed, believed him to have
been sincerely repentant. In addition to his short pieces he wrote
a <i>Satyr against Mankind</i>, and a tragedy, <i>Valentinian</i>, adapted from
Beaumont and Fletcher.</p><br />

a minister of the Congregationalist Church, and ultimately Prof. of
English Literature in Univ. Coll., London. He was a contributor
to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and is best known by his <i>Eclipse of Faith</i>
(1852), a reply to F.W. Newman's <i>Phases of Faith</i>. This work,
which displays remarkable acuteness and logical power, had great
popularity.</p><br />

<a name='ROGERS_SAMUEL_1763_1855'></a><p><b>ROGERS, SAMUEL (1763-1855).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a banker in
London, received a careful private education, and entered the bank,
of which, on his father's death, he became the principal partner.
From his early youth he showed a marked taste for literature and
the fine arts, which his wealth enabled him to gratify; and in his
later years he was a well-known leader in society and a munificent
patron of artists and men of letters, his breakfasts, at which he
delighted to assemble celebrities in all departments, being famous.
He was the author of the following poems: <i>The Pleasures of Memory</i>
(1792), <i>Columbus</i> (1810), <i>Jacqueline</i> (1814), <i>Human Life</i> (1819), and
<i>Italy</i> (1822). R. was emphatically the poet of taste, and his writings,
while full of allusion and finished description, rarely show passion or
intensity of feeling; but are rather the reflections and memory-pictures
of a man of high culture and refinement expressed in polished
verse. He had considerable powers of conversation and sarcasm.
He was offered, but declined, the laureateship.</p><br />

at Thornton, Yorkshire, was at Oxf. Impressed by the uncertainty
and the snares of life he decided to become a hermit, a resolution
which he carried out with somewhat romantic circumstances.
He wrote various religious treatises in Latin and English, turned the
Psalms into English verse, and composed a poem&mdash;<i>The Pricke of

which was rising against certain Papal pretensions and doctrines.</p><br />

a place in literature for his excellent and appreciative biography of
his father-in-law. He was a member of various Parliaments between
1529 and 1558. Although he remained a Roman Catholic, he was
permitted to retain his office of prothonotary of the Court of King's

all his spare time to mental improvement. Subsequently he entered
the office of an attorney, and in due time went into business on his
own account, continuing, however, his literary studies. In 1799 he
joined a local bank as partner and manager, which proved an unfortunate
step, as the bank was obliged, in 1816, to suspend payment.
In 1795 he rose into fame at a bound by his <i>Life of Lorenzo
de' Medici</i>. It was followed in 1805 by the <i>Life and Pontificate of
Leo the Tenth</i>, which, though also a work of great ability, had not
the same success&mdash;his treatment of the Reformation offending
Protestants and Roman Catholics alike. Both works were translated
into various languages. He also wrote some poems, including
<i>The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast</i>, and several
pamphlets on political questions, including the slave-trade, of which
he was a determined opponent. He also took a leading part in the
public life of Liverpool, which he represented in Parliament for a
few years. He was an accomplished botanist.</p><br />

principal work of his life, his translations from the Italian, including

sister of <a href='#ROSSETTI_DANTE_GABRIEL_1828_1882'>Dante Gabriel R.</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), was <i>b.</i> in London, where she lived
all her life. She began to write poetry in early girlhood, some of her
earliest verse appearing in 1850 in the <i>Germ</i>, the magazine of the
pre-Raphaelites, of which her brother was one of the founders.
Her subsequent publications were <i>Goblin Market and other Poems</i>
(1862), <i>The Prince's Progress</i> (1866), <i>A Pageant and other Poems</i>
(1881), and <i>Verses</i> (1893). <i>New Poems</i> (1896) appeared after her
death. <i>Sing-Song</i> was a book of verses for children. Her life was
<a name='Page_322'></a>a very retired one, passed largely in attending on her mother, who
lived until 1886, and in religious duties. She twice rejected proposals
of marriage. Her poetry is characterised by imaginative
power, exquisite expression, and simplicity and depth of thought.
She rarely imitated any forerunner, and drew her inspiration from
her own experiences of thought and feeling. Many of her poems are
definitely religious in form; more are deeply imbued with religious
feeling and motive. In addition to her poems she wrote <i>Commonplace
and other Stories</i>, and <i>The Face of the Deep</i>, a striking and suggestive
commentary on the Apocalypse.</p><br />

<a name='ROSSETTI_DANTE_GABRIEL_1828_1882'></a><p><b>ROSSETTI, DANTE GABRIEL (1828-1882).</b>
&mdash;Poet and
painter, was <i>b.</i> in London. His <i>f.</i> was Gabriele Rossetti, an Italian
scholar, who came to England in 1824, and was Prof. of Italian in
King's Coll., London. His mother was Frances Polidori, English
on her mother's side, so that the poet was three-fourths Italian, and
one-fourth English. He was <i>ed.</i> at King's Coll. School, and began
the systematic study of painting in 1842, and in 1848, with Holman
Hunt, Millais, and others, founded the pre-Raphaelite school of
painting. In 1849 he exhibited the &quot;Girlhood of Mary Virgin,&quot; and
among his other pictures are &quot;Beata Beatrix,&quot; &quot;Monna Vanna,&quot;
and &quot;Dante's Dream.&quot; Simultaneously with art he worked hard
at poetry, and by 1847 he had written <i>The Blessed Damozel</i> and
<i>Hand and Soul</i> (both of which appeared in the <i>Germ</i>, the magazine
of the pre-Raphaelites), <i>Retro me Sathanas</i>, <i>The Portrait</i>, and <i>The
Choice</i>, and in 1861 he brought out a vol. of translations from the
early Italian poets under the title of <i>Dante and his Circle</i>. The
death of his wife in 1862, after a married life of less than two years,
told heavily upon him, as did various attacks upon his poetry, including
that of <a href='#BUCHANAN_ROBERT_1841_1901'>Robert Buchanan</a> (<i>q.v.</i>)&mdash;<i>The Fleshly School of
Poetry</i>&mdash;to which he replied with <i>The Stealthy School of Criticism</i>.
His <i>Poems</i> which, in the vehemence of his grief, he had buried in the
coffin of his wife, and which were afterwards exhumed, appeared in
1870; and his last literary effort, <i>Ballads and Sonnets</i>, containing
the sonnets forming <i>The House of Life</i>, in 1881. In his later years
he suffered acutely from neuralgia, which led to the habit of taking
chloral. Rossetti was fastidious in composition; his poems are as
remarkable for condensation, finish, and exact expression of the
poet's thought as for their sumptuous colouring and rich concrete
imagery. In later years he was subject to depression, and became
somewhat embittered, and much of a recluse.</p>

&mdash;Versifier of the Psalms, a
Cornishman, and a prominent Puritan, took a leading part in Parliament,
was Provost of Eton, and wrote several theological and devotional
works. His memory has, however, been chiefly kept green
by his translation of the Psalms into verse, which with some modifications
was adopted by the Church and Parliament of Scotland for
use in public worship, a position which it held almost exclusively
until the middle of the 19th century. It is still in universal use in
the Presbyterian churches of that country, though now accompanied
<a name='Page_323'></a>by hymns. Though rough, and sometimes, through the endeavour
to maintain literalness, grotesque, it is strong and simple, and not
seldom rises to a certain severe beauty; and association has endeared
it to many generations of Scottish Christians.</p><br />

law, but inheriting an income of &pound;300 a year, he devoted himself to
literature, and produced several dramas, including <i>The Ambitious
Stepmother</i>, <i>The Fair Penitent</i>, and <i>Jane Shore</i>. The last, which is
his best, contains some scenes of true pathos, and holds its place.
He also wrote some poems, and translated Lucan. R., who was a
man of very engaging manners, was the friend of Pope, Swift, and
Addison, and received many lucrative appointments, including
that of Under-Sec. of State. He has the distinction of being the
first ed. and biographer of Shakespeare (1709). He was appointed
Poet Laureate in 1715, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, with
an epitaph by Pope.</p><br />

the Advocates' Library in Edin., of which in 1730 he became Librarian.
In 1714 he <i>pub.</i> his <i>Rudiments of the Latin Tongue</i>, which was
for long the recognised Latin grammar in the schools of Scotland.
He was made printer to the Univ. in 1728. R., who was one of the
greatest of Scottish Latinists, produced an ed. of the works of George
Buchanan, and an ed. of <i>Livy</i> said to be &quot;immaculate.&quot; He also
reprinted, with notes, Gavin Douglas's version of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>.</p><br />

<a name='RUSKIN_JOHN_1819_1900'></a><p><b>RUSKIN, JOHN (1819-1900).</b>
&mdash;Writer on art, economics,
and sociology, was <i>b.</i> in London, the <i>s.</i> of a wealthy wine merchant,
a Scotsman. Brought up under intellectually and morally bracing
Puritan influences, his education was mainly private until he went
to Oxf. in 1836; he remained until 1840, when a serious illness interrupted
his studies, and led to a six months' visit to Italy. On his
return in 1842 he took his degree. In 1840 he had made the acquaintance
of Turner, and this, together with a visit to Venice, constituted
a turning point in his life. In 1843 appeared the first vol.
of <i>Modern Painters</i>, the object of which was to insist upon the
superiority in landscape of the moderns, and especially of Turner, to
<a name='Page_324'></a>all the ancient masters. The earnestness and originality of the
author and the splendour of the style at once called attention to the
work which, however, awakened a chorus of protest from the adherents
of the ancients. A second vol. appeared in 1846, the third
and fourth in 1856, and the fifth in 1860. Meanwhile he had <i>pub.</i>
<i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i> (1849), <i>The Stones of Venice</i> (1851-53),
perhaps his greatest work, <i>Lectures on Architecture and Painting</i>
(1854), <i>Elements of Drawing</i> (1856), and <i>Elements of Perspective</i>
(1859). During the 17 years between the publication of the first
and the last vols. of <i>Modern Painters</i> his views alike on religion and
art had become profoundly modified, and the necessity of a radical
change in the moral and intellectual attitude of the age towards
religion, art, and economics in their bearing upon life and social
conditions had become his ruling idea. He now assumed the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
the prophet as Carlyle, by whose teaching he was profoundly influenced,
had done, and the rest of his life was spent in the endeavour
to turn the mind of the nation in the direction he desired. <i>The
Political Economy of Art</i> (1857) showed the line in which his mind
was moving; but it was in <i>Unto this Last</i>, <i>pub.</i> in the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i> in 1860, that he began fully to develop his views. It
brought down upon him a storm of opposition and obloquy which
continued for years, and which, while it acted injuriously upon his
highly sensitive nervous system, had no effect in silencing him or
modifying his views. There followed <i>Munera Pulveris</i> (Gifts of the
Dust), <i>The Crown of Wild Olive</i>, <i>Sesame and Lilies</i> (1865), <i>Time and
Tide by Wear and Tyne</i>, and innumerable fugitive articles. In 1869 R.
was appointed first Slade Prof. of the Fine Arts at Oxf., and endowed
a school of drawing in the Univ. His successive courses of lectures
were <i>pub.</i> as <i>Aratra Pentelici</i> (Ploughs of Pentelicus) (1870), <i>The
Eagle's Nest</i> (1872), <i>Ariadne Florentina</i> (1872), and <i>Love's Meinie</i>
(1873). Contemporaneously with these he issued with more or less
regularity, as health permitted, <i>Fors Clavigera</i> (Chance the Club-bearer),
a series of miscellaneous notes and essays, sold by the
author himself direct to the purchasers, the first of a series of experiments&mdash;of
which the Guild of St. George, a tea room, and a road-making
enterprise were other examples&mdash;in practical economics.
After the death of his mother in 1871 he purchased a small property,
Brantwood, in the Lake district, where he lived for the remainder
of his life, and here he brought out in monthly parts his last
work, <i>Pr&aelig;terita</i>, an autobiography, 24 parts of which appeared,
bringing down the story to 1864. Here he <i>d.</i> on January 20, 1900.
R. was a man of noble character and generous impulses, but
highly strung, irritable, and somewhat intolerant. He is one of our
greatest stylists, copious, eloquent, picturesque, and highly coloured.
His influence on his time was very great, at first in the department
of art, in which he was for a time regarded as the supreme authority,
later and increasingly in the realms of economics and morals, in
which he was at first looked upon as an unpractical dreamer. He <i>m.</i>
in 1848, but the union proved unhappy, and was dissolved in 1855.</p>

He entered Parliament in 1813, and became one of the most eminent
English statesmen of the 19th century. He uniformly acted with the
Whig and afterwards with the Liberal party, advocated all measures
of progress, especially the removal of tests, the extension of education,
and Parliamentary reform. He was the leader of his party in
the House of Commons from 1834-55, represented the City of London
from 1841 until his elevation to the peerage in 1861, and held
the offices of Paymaster of the Forces, Home Sec., Colonial Sec.,
Foreign Sec., and Prime Minister, which last he held twice, 1846-52,

army. He was also correspondent in India during the Mutiny, in
America during the Civil War, and during the Austro-Prussian War of
1866, and the Franco-German War of 1870-71, in South Africa in

1627 he was settled as minister of Anwoth in Galloway, whence he
was banished to Aberdeen for nonconformity. On the re-establishment
of Presbytery in 1638 he was made Prof. of Divinity at St.
Andrews, and in 1651 Principal of St. Mary's Coll. there, and he was
one of the Scottish Commissioners to the Westminster Assembly.
At the Restoration he was deprived of all his offices. He was a
formidable controversialist, and a strenuous upholder of the divine
right of Presbytery. Among his polemical works are <i>Due Right of
Presbyteries</i> (1644), <i>Lex Rex</i> (1644), and <i>Free Disputation against
Pretended Liberty of Conscience</i>. <i>Lex Rex</i> was, after the Restoration,
burned by the common hangman, and led to the citation of the
<a name='Page_326'></a>author for high treason, which his death prevented from taking
effect. His chief fame, however, rests upon his spiritual and devotional

a rich imagery which, while highly relished by some, repel others.</p><br />

Entering the Church he rose to be Bishop of Lincoln. His work on
logic, <i>Logic&aelig; Artis Compendium</i> (1615), was long a standard treatise
on the subject. His sermons also were admired; but he is perhaps
best remembered by his <i>Nine Cases of Conscience Resolved</i> (1678), in
consideration of which he has been placed at the head of English

Macclesfield. He was the friend of Johnson in the early and miserable
days of the latter in London; and in <i>The Lives of the Poets</i> J.
has given his story as set forth by himself, which is, if true, a singular
record of maternal cruelty. There are strong reasons, however, for
doubting whether it was anything but a tissue of falsehoods mingled
with gross exaggerations of fact. He led a wildly irregular life,
killed a gentleman in a tavern brawl, for which he was sentenced
to death, but pardoned; and by his waywardness alienated nearly
all who wished to befriend him. For a time he had a pension of &pound;50
from Queen Caroline on condition of his writing an ode yearly on her
birthday. He wrote <i>Love in a Veil</i> (1718) (comedy) and <i>Sir Thomas

which he turned to account in two vivacious novels, <i>Tom

in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, where they attained deserved
popularity. They have frequently been reprinted. The author,

<a name='SCOTT_SIR_WALTER_1771_1832'></a><p><b>SCOTT, SIR WALTER (1771-1832).</b>
&mdash;Poet, novelist, and
biographer, <i>s.</i> of Walter S., a Writer to the Signet in Edinburgh, and
Margaret Rutherford, <i>dau.</i> of one of the Prof. of Medicine in the
Univ. there. Through both parents he was connected with several
old Border families; his <i>f.</i> was a scion of the Scotts of Harden, well
known in Border history. In early childhood he suffered from a
severe fever, one of the effects of which was a permanent lameness,
and for some time he was delicate. The native vigour of his constitution,
however, soon asserted itself, and he became a man of
exceptional strength. Much of his childhood was spent at his
grandfather's farm at Sandyknowe, Roxburghshire, and almost
from the dawn of intelligence he began to show an interest in the
traditionary lore which was to have so powerful an influence on his
future life, an interest which was nourished and stimulated by
several of the older members of his family, especially one of his aunts.
At this stage he was a quick-witted, excitable child, who required
rather to be restrained than pressed forward. At the age of 7 he was
strong enough to be sent to the High School of Edinburgh, where he
was more remarkable for miscellaneous and out-of-the-way knowledge
and his powers of story-telling than for proficiency in the
ordinary course of study; and notwithstanding his lameness, he was
to be found in the forefront wherever adventure or fighting were
to be had. Thereafter he was for three sessions at the Univ., where
he bore much the same character as at school. He was, however, far
from idle, and was all the time following the irresistible bent, which
ultimately led to such brilliant results, in a course of insatiable reading
of ballads and romances, to enlarge which he had by the time he
was 15 acquired a working knowledge of French and Italian, and
<a name='Page_329'></a>had made the acquaintance of Dante and Ariosto in the original.
Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1765, came into his hands
in 1784, and proved one of the most formative influences of this
period. At 15 he was apprenticed to his <i>f.</i>, but preferring the higher
branch of the profession, he studied for the Bar, to which he was
called in 1792. He did not, however, forego his favourite studies,
but ransacked the Advocates' Library for old manuscripts, in the
deciphering of which he became so expert that his assistance soon
came to be invoked by antiquarians of much longer standing.
Although he worked hard at law his ideal was not the attainment of
an extensive practice, but rather of a fairly paid post which should
leave him leisure for his favourite pursuits, and this he succeeded in
reaching, being appointed first in 1799 Sheriff of Selkirk, and next in
1812 one of the Principal Clerks to the Court of Session, which
together brought him an income of &pound;1600. Meanwhile in 1795 he
had translated B&uuml;rger's ballad of <i>Lenore</i>, and in the following year he
made his first appearance in print by publishing it along with a translation
of <i>The Wild Huntsman</i> by the same author. About the same
time he made the acquaintance of &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis, to whose collection
of <i>Tales of Wonder</i> he contributed the ballads of <i>Glenfinlas</i>, <i>The
Eve of St. John</i>, and <i>The Grey Brother</i>; and he <i>pub.</i> in 1799 a translation
of Goethe's <i>Goetz von Berlichingen</i>. In 1797 he was <i>m.</i> to Miss
Charlotte Margaret Charpentier, the <i>dau.</i> of a French gentleman of
good position. The year 1802 saw the publication of Scott's first
work of real importance, <i>The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, of
which 2 vols. appeared, the third following in the next year. In
1804 he went to reside at Ashestiel on the Tweed, where he ed. the
old romance, <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, and in 1805 he produced his first great
original work, <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, which was received with
great favour, and decided that literature was thenceforth to be the
main work of his life. In the same year the first few chapters of
<i>Waverley</i> were written; but the unfavourable opinion of a friend led
to the MS. being laid aside for nearly 10 years. In 1806 S. began,
by a secret partnership, that association with the Ballantynes which
resulted so unfortunately for him 20 years later. <i>Marmion</i> was
<i>pub.</i> in 1808: it was even more popular than the <i>Lay</i>, and raised his
reputation proportionately. The same year saw the publication of
his elaborate ed. of Dryden with a Life, and was also marked by a
rupture with Jeffrey, with whom he had been associated as a contributor
to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and by the establishment of the
new firm of J. Ballantyne and Co., of which the first important publication
was <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>, which appeared in 1810, <i>The
Vision of Don Roderick</i> following in 1811. In 1812 S. purchased
land on the Tweed near Melrose, and built his famous house, Abbotsford,
the adornment of which became one of the chief pleasures of
his life, and which he made the scene of a noble and kindly hospitality.
In the same year he <i>pub.</i> <i>Rokeby</i>, and in 1813 <i>The Bridal of
Triermain</i>, while 1814 saw <i>The Life and Works of Swift</i> in 19 vols.,
and was made illustrious by the appearance of <i>Waverley</i>, the two
coming out in the same week, the latter, of course, like its successors,
anonymously. The next year, <i>The Lord of the Isles</i>, <i>Guy Mannering</i>,
and <i>The Field of Waterloo</i> appeared, and the next again, 1816,
<i>Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk</i>, <i>The Antiquary</i>, <i>The Black Dwarf</i>, and<a name='Page_330'></a>
<i>Old Mortality</i>, while 1817 saw <i>Harold the Dauntless</i> and <i>Rob Roy</i>.
The enormous strain which S. had been undergoing as official, man
of letters, and man of business, began at length to tell upon him, and
in this same year, 1817, he had the first of a series of severe seizures
of cramp in the stomach, to which, however, his indomitable spirit
refused to yield, and several of his next works, <i>The Heart of Midlothian</i>
(1818), by many considered his masterpiece, <i>The Bride of
Lammermoor</i>, <i>The Legend of Montrose</i>, and <i>Ivanhoe</i>, all of 1819, were
dictated to amanuenses, while he was too ill to hold a pen. In 1820
<i>The Monastery</i>, in which the public began to detect a falling off in
the powers of the still generally unknown author, appeared. The
immediately following <i>Abbot</i>, however, showed a recovery. <i>Kenilworth</i>
and <i>The Pirate</i> followed in 1821, <i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i> in 1822;
<i>Peveril of the Peak</i>, <i>Quentin Durward</i>, and <i>St. Ronan's Well</i> in 1823;
<i>Redgauntlet</i> in 1824, and <i>Tales of the Crusaders</i> (<i>The Betrothed</i> and
<i>The Talisman</i>) in 1825. By this time S. had long reached a pinnacle
of fame such as perhaps no British man of letters has ever attained
during his lifetime. He had for a time been the most admired poet
of his day, and though latterly somewhat eclipsed by Byron, he
still retained great fame as a poet. He also possessed a great reputation
as an antiquary, one of the chief revivers of interest in our
ancient literature, and as the biographer and ed. of several of our
great writers; while the incognito which he maintained in regard to
his novels was to many a very partial veil. The unprecedented profits
of his writings had made him, as he believed, a man of wealth;
his social prestige was immense; he had in 1820 been made a baronet,
when that was still a real distinction, and he had been the acknowledged
representative of his country when the King visited it in 1822.
All this was now to change, and the fabric of prosperity which he had
raised by his genius and labour, and which had never spoiled the
simplicity and generosity of his character, was suddenly to crumble
into ruin with, however, the result of revealing him as the possessor
of qualities even greater and nobler than any he had shown in his
happier days. The publishing and printing firms with which he had
been connected fell in the commercial crisis of 1826, and S. found
himself at 55, and with failing health, involved in liabilities amounting
to &pound;130,000. Never was adversity more manfully and gallantly
met. Notwithstanding the crushing magnitude of the disaster and
the concurrent sorrow of his wife's illness, which soon issued in her
death, he deliberately set himself to the herculean task of working
off his debts, asking only that time might be given him. The secret
of his authorship was now, of course, revealed, and his efforts were
crowned with a marvellous measure of success. <i>Woodstock</i>, his first
publication after the crash, appeared in the same year and brought
&pound;8000; by 1828 he had earned &pound;40,000. In 1827 <i>The Two Drovers</i>,
<i>The Highland Widow</i>, and <i>The Surgeon's Daughter</i>, forming the first
series of <i>Chronicles of the Canongate</i>, appeared together with <i>The Life
of Napoleon</i> in 9 vols., and the first series of <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>;
in 1828 <i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i> and the second series of <i>Tales of a
Grandfather</i>, <i>Anne of Geierstein</i>, a third series of the <i>Tales</i>, and the
commencement of a complete ed. of the novels in 1829; a fourth and
last series of <i>Tales</i>, <i>History of Scotland</i>, and other work in 1830.
Then at last the overworked brain gave way, and during this year
<a name='Page_331'></a>he had more than one paralytic seizure. He was sent abroad for
change and rest, and a Government frigate was placed at his disposal.
But all was in vain; he never recovered, and though in
temporary rallies he produced two more novels, <i>Count Robert of
Paris</i> and <i>Castle Dangerous</i>, both in 1831, which only showed that
the spell was broken, he gradually sank, and <i>d.</i> at Abbotsford on
September 21, 1832.</p>

<p>The work which S. accomplished, whether looked at as regards its
mass or its quality, is alike marvellous. In mere amount his output
in each of the four departments of poetry, prose fiction, history and
biography, and miscellaneous literature is sufficient to fill an ordinary
literary life. Indeed the quantity of his acknowledged work in
other departments was held to be the strongest argument against
the possibility of his being the author of the novels. The achievement
of such a result demanded a power of steady, methodical, and
rapid work almost unparalleled in the history of literature. When
we turn to its quality we are struck by the range of subject and the
variableness of the treatment. In general there is the same fulness
of mind directed by strong practical sense and judgment, but the
style is often heavy, loose, and even slipshod, and in most of his
works there are &quot;patches&quot; in which he falls far below his best. His
poetry, though as a whole belonging to the second class, is full of
broad and bold effects, picturesqueness, and an irresistible rush and
freshness. As a lyrist, however, he stands much higher, and in such
gems as &quot;Proud Maisie&quot; and &quot;A weary lot is thine, Fair Maid,&quot; he
takes his place among our greatest singers. His chief fame rests, of
course, upon the novels. Here also, however, there is the same inequality
and irregularity, but there is a singular command over his
genius in virtue of which the fusing, creating imagination responds
to his call, and is at its greatest just where it is most needed. For
the variety, truth, and aliveness of his characters he has probably no
equal since Shakespeare, and though, of course, coming far behind,
he resembles him alike in his range and in his insight. The most
remarkable feature in his character is the union of an imagination
of the first order with practical sagacity and manly sanity, in this
also resembling his great predecessor.</p>

and Camb. In 1863 he became Prof. of Latin at Univ. Coll., London,
and was Prof. of Modern History at Camb. from 1869 until his
death. In 1865 appeared anonymously <i>Ecce Homo</i>, a work which
created intense excitement and keen controversy in the theological
and religious world. Other works were <i>The Life and Times of Stein</i>,
the Prussian statesman (1879), <i>Natural Religion</i> (1882), <i>The Expansion

<a name='SELDEN_JOHN_1584_1654'></a><p><b>SELDEN, JOHN (1584-1654).</b>
&mdash;Jurist and scholar, <i>b.</i> near
Worthing, Sussex, the <i>s.</i> of a farmer who was also a musician, <i>ed.</i> at
Chichester and Oxf., and studied law at Clifford's Inn and the Inner
Temple. His learning soon attracted attention and, though practising
little, he was consulted on points involving legal erudition.
His first work, <i>Analecton Anglo-Britannicon</i>, a chronological collection
of English records down to the Norman invasion, was written
in 1606, though not <i>pub.</i> till 1615. In 1610 appeared a treatise on
the <i>Duello, or Single Combat</i>; and in 1614 his largest English work
on <i>Titles of Honour</i>, full of profound learning, and still a high
authority. Three years later, 1617, he wrote in Latin his treatise,
<i>De Deis Syris</i> (on the Gods of Syria), an inquiry into polytheism,
specially with reference to the false deities mentioned in Scripture.
His reputation as a scholar had now become European. In 1618 he
incurred the indignation of the King and the clergy by his <i>History of
Tithes</i>, in which he denied their claim to be a divine institution.
Called before the High Commission he made a statement regretting
the publication of the book though not withdrawing any of its statements.
In 1621 he suffered a brief imprisonment for withstanding
some of James's doctrines as to the privileges of Parliament. Two
years later he was elected member for Lancaster. As a politician
his views were moderate, and all along he endeavoured to repress the
<a name='Page_333'></a>zeal of the extremists on both sides. He was imprisoned in the
Tower for four years, 1630-34. During the final struggle of King
and Parliament he was much employed; but like most men of
moderate views, was frequently under suspicion, and after the execution
of the King, to which he was strongly opposed, he took little to
do with public matters. He was a lay member of the Westminster
Assembly, 1643, where his profound knowledge of the original
tongues made him somewhat of a terror to certain extremists among
the divines. He had at an early age been appointed steward to the
Earl of Kent, and at the house of his widow, with whom he had long
lived in such close friendship as to give rise to the belief that they
were <i>m.</i>, he <i>d.</i> Among other works may be mentioned a description
of the Arundel Marbles (1629), a treatise concerning the Jewish
calendar (1646), and, specially, his <i>Table Talk</i>, <i>pub.</i> 1689, of which
Coleridge said &quot;there is more weighty bullion sense in this book than
I can find in the same number of pages of any uninspired writer.&quot;
He was likewise the author of various treatises on constitutional
matters and the law of nations, including <i>Mare Clausum</i> (a Closed
Sea), in defence of the property of England in its circumfluent seas.
Most of these were written in Latin.</p>

who pilloried S. as Doeg in the second part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>.
S. essayed a reply in <i>Absalom Senior</i>. He wrote against the

became a popular dramatist. Among his comedies, in which he
displayed considerable comic power and truth to nature, may be
mentioned <i>The Sullen Lovers</i> (1668), <i>Royal Shepherdess</i> (1668), <i>The
Humourists</i> (1671), and <i>The Miser</i> (1672). He attached himself to the
Whigs, and when Dryden attacked them in <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>
and <i>The Medal</i>, had the temerity to assail him scurrilously in <i>The
Medal of John Bayes</i> (1682). The castigation which this evoked in
<i>MacFlecknoe</i> and in the second part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, in
which S. figures as &quot;Og,&quot; has conferred upon him an unenviable
immortality. He may have found some consolation in his succession
to Dryden as Poet Laureate when, at the Revolution, the latter was
deprived of the office.</p>

existence of a moral sense, a view subsequently developed by the
Scottish school of philosophy. The style of S. is stately and sonorous
but laboured. He <i>d.</i> at Naples, whither he had gone in search

<a name='SHAKESPEARE_WILLIAM_1564_1616'></a><p><b>SHAKESPEARE, WILLIAM (1564-1616).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist and
poet, <i>b.</i> at Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, on 22nd or 23rd, and
baptised on 26th April, 1564. On his father's side he belonged to a
good yeoman stock, though his descent cannot be certainly traced
beyond his grandfather, a Richard S., settled at Snitterfield, near
Stratford. His <i>f.</i>, John S., appears to have been a man of intelligence
and energy, who set up in Stratford as a dealer in all kinds of
agricultural produce, to which he added the trade of a glover. He
became prosperous, and gained the respect of his neighbours, as is
evidenced by his election in succession to all the municipal honours
of his community, including those of chief alderman and high bailiff.
He <i>m.</i> Mary, youngest <i>dau.</i> of Robert Arden, a wealthy farmer at
Wilmcote, and a younger branch of a family of considerable distinction,
and whose tenant Richard S. had been. On her father's death
Mary inherited Asbies, a house with 50 acres of land attached to it.
The first children of the marriage were two <i>dau.</i>, who <i>d.</i> in infancy.
William was the third, and others followed, of whom three sons, Gilbert,
Richard, and Edmund, and a <i>dau.</i> Joan, reached maturity. He
was <i>ed.</i> with his brother Gilbert at Stratford Grammar School, where
he learned Latin from Lilly's Grammar, English, writing, and arithmetic.
He probably read some of the Latin classics and may have
got a little Greek, and though his learned friend Ben Jonson credits
him with &quot;little Latin and less Greek,&quot; Aubrey says he &quot;knew
Latin pretty well.&quot; This happy state of matters continued until he
was about 13, when his <i>f.</i> fell into misfortune, which appears to
have gone on deepening until the success and prosperity of the poet
in later years enabled him to reinstate the family in its former position.
Meanwhile, however, he was taken from school, and appears
to have been made to assist his <i>f.</i> in his business. The next certain
fact in his history is his marriage in November, 1582, when he was
18, to Ann Hathaway, <i>dau.</i> of a yeoman at the neighbouring hamlet
of Shottery, and 8 years his senior. Various circumstances point to
the marriage having been against the wishes of his own family, and
pressed on by that of his wife, and that it was so urged in defence of
the reputation of the lady, and as perhaps might be expected, they
indicate, though not conclusively, that it did not prove altogether
happy. The birth, in May, 1583, of his eldest child Susannah (who
is said to have inherited something of his wit and practical ability,
and who <i>m.</i> a Dr. John Hall), followed in the next year by that of
twins, Hamnet and Judith, and the necessity of increased means, led
to his departure from Stratford, whence he travelled on foot to
London, where the next 23 years of his life were mainly spent. The
tradition that his departure was also caused by trouble into which
he had got by killing the deer of Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcote, is
credible. Leaving Stratford in 1585 or the beginning of 1586, he
seems at once to have turned to the theatres, where he soon found
work, although, as Rowe, his first biographer, says, &quot;in a very mean
<a name='Page_336'></a>rank.&quot; It was not long, however, before he had opportunities of
showing his capacities as an actor, with the result that he shortly
became a member of one of the chief acting companies of the day,
which was then under the patronage of the Earl of Leicester, and
after being associated with the names of various other noblemen, at
last on the accession of James I. became known as the King's Company.
It played originally in &quot;The Theatre&quot; in Shoreditch, the
first playhouse to be erected in England, and afterwards in the
&quot;Rose&quot; on the Bankside, Southwark, the scene of the earliest successes
of S. as an actor and playwright. Subsequently to 1594, he
acted occasionally in a playhouse in Newington Butts, and between
1595 and 1599 in the &quot;Curtain.&quot; In the latter year the &quot;Globe&quot;
was built on the Bankside, and 10 years later the &quot;Blackfriars:&quot;
and with these two, but especially with the former, the remainder of
his professional life was associated. It is not unlikely that he visited
various provincial towns; but that he was ever in Scotland or on the
Continent is improbable. Among the plays in which he appeared
were Jonson's <i>Every Man in his Humour</i> and <i>Sejanus</i>, and in <i>Hamlet</i>
he played &quot;The Ghost;&quot; and it is said that his brother Gilbert as an
old man remembered his appearing as &quot;Adam&quot; in <i>As You Like It</i>.
By 1595 S. was famous and prosperous; his earlier plays had been
written and acted, and his poems <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, and <i>Lucrece</i>,
and probably most of the sonnets, had been <i>pub.</i> and received with
extraordinary favour. He had also powerful friends and patrons, including
the Earl of Southampton, and was known at Court. By the
end of the century he is mentioned by <a href='#MERES_FRANCIS_1565_1647'>Francis Meres</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) as the
greatest man of letters of the day, and his name had become so valuable
that it was affixed by unscrupulous publishers to works, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Locrine</i>, <i>Oldcastle</i>, and <i>The Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, by other and often
very inferior hands. He had also resumed a close connection with
Stratford, and was making the restoration of the family position
there the object of his ambition. In accordance with this he induced
his <i>f.</i> to apply for a grant of arms, which was given, and he
purchased New Place, the largest house in the village. With the
income derived from his profession as an actor and dramatist, and
his share of the profits of the Globe and Blackfriars theatres, and
in view of the business capacity with which he managed his affairs,
he may be regarded as almost a wealthy man, and he went on adding
to his influence in Stratford by buying land. He had enjoyed
the favour of Elizabeth, and her death in 1603 did nothing to disturb
his fortunes, as he stood quite as well with her successor. His company
received the title of the &quot;King's Servants,&quot; and his plays were
frequently performed before the Court. But notwithstanding this,
the clouds had gathered over his life. The conspiracy of Essex
in 1601 had involved several of his friends and patrons in disaster;
he had himself been entangled in the unhappy love affair which is
supposed to be referred to in some of his sonnets, and he had suffered
unkindness at the hands of a friend. For a few years his dramas
breathe the darkness and bitterness of a heart which has been sounding
the depths of sad experience. He soon, however, emerged from
this and, passing through the period of the great tragedies, reached the
serene triumph and peace of his later dramas. In 1611 S. severed his
long connection with the stage, and retired to Stratford, where the
<a name='Page_337'></a>remaining five years of his life were spent in honour and prosperity.
Early in 1616 his health began to give way, and he made his will.
In the spring he received a visit from his friends, Jonson and Drayton,
and the festivity with which it was celebrated seems to have
brought on a fever, of which he <i>d.</i> on April 23. He was survived by
his wife and his two <i>dau.</i>, both of whom were married. His descendants
<i>d.</i> out with his grand-daughter, Elizabeth Hall.</p>

<p>Immense research has been spent upon the writings of S., with the
result of substantial agreement as to the order of their production
and the sources from which their subjects were drawn; for S. rarely
troubled himself with the construction of a story, but adopting one
already existing reared upon it as a foundation one of those marvellous
superstructures which make him the greatest painter and interpreter
of human character the world has ever seen. His period
of literary production extends from about 1588 to 1613, and falls
naturally into four divisions, which Prof. Dowden has named, &quot;In
the Workshop&quot; ending in 1596; &quot;In the World&quot; 1596-1601;
&quot;Out of the Depths&quot; 1601-1608; and &quot;On the Heights&quot; 1608-1613.
Of the 37 plays usually attributed to him, 16 only were <i>pub.</i>
during his lifetime, so that the exact order in which they were
produced cannot always be determined with certainty. Recent
authorities are agreed to the extent that while they do not invariably
place the individual plays in the same order, they are almost
entirely at one as to which belong to the four periods respectively.
The following list shows in a condensed form the order according to
Mr. Sidney Lee (<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>) with the most
probable dates and the original sources on which the plays are
founded.</p>

<p>The evidence as to chronology is three-fold&mdash;(1) External, such as
entries in registers of Stationers' Company, contemporary references,
or details as to the companies of actors; (2) External and internal
combined, such as references in the plays to events or books,
etc.; (3) Internal, content and treatment, progressive changes in
versification, presence of frequency of rhyme, etc. The genius of
S. was so intensely dramatic that it is impossible to say confidently
when he speaks in his own character. The sonnets, written probably
1591-94 have, however, been thought to be of a more personal
nature, and to contain indications as to his character and
history, and much labour and ingenuity have been expended to
make them yield their secrets. It is generally agreed that they fall
into two sections, the first consisting of sonnets 1 to 126 addressed to
a young man, probably Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, the
friend and patron of S., and 9 years his junior; and the second from
127 to 154 addressed or referring to a woman in whose snares the
writer had become entangled, and by whom he was betrayed. Some,
however, have held that they are allegorical, or partly written on
behalf of others, or that the emotion they express is dramatic and
not personal.</p>

<p>There are contemporary references to S. which show him to
have been generally held in high regard. Thus Ben Jonson says,
&quot;I loved the man, and do honour to his memory, on this side
idolatry, as much as any,&quot; and Chettle refers to &quot;His demeanour no
<a name='Page_339'></a>lesse civil than exelent in the qualities he professes.&quot; The only exception
is a reference to him in Greene's <i>Groat's-worth of Wit</i>, as &quot;an
upstart crow beautified with our feathers, that with his tyger's heart
wrapt in a player's hide supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a
blanke verse as the best of you ... and is in his own conceit the
only Shake-scene in a countrie.&quot; He is said to have written rapidly
and with facility, rarely requiring to alter what he had set down. In
addition to his generally received works, others have been attributed
to him, some of which have been already mentioned: the only two
which appear to have serious claims to consideration are <i>The Two
Noble Kinsmen</i>, partly by Fletcher, and <i>Edward III.</i>, of which part
of Act I. and the whole of Act II. have been thought to be Shakespeare's.
On the other hand a theory has been propounded that
none of the plays bearing his name were really his, but that they were
written by <a href='#BACON_FRANCIS_LORD_VERULAM_AND_VISCOUNT_ST_ALBANS_1561_1626'>Bacon</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). This extraordinary view has been widely
supported, chiefly in America, and has been sometimes maintained;
with considerable ability and misplaced ingenuity.</p>

(<i>q.v.</i>) and <a href='#GODWIN_MRS_MARY_WOLLSTONECRAFT_1759_1797'>Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, his wife (<i>q.v.</i>). In 1814 she went to

When abroad she saw much of Byron, and it was at his villa on the
Lake of Geneva that she conceived the idea of her famous novel of
<i>Frankenstein</i> (1818), a ghastly but powerful work. None of her
other novels, including <i>The Last Man</i> and <i>Lodore</i>, had the same
success. She contributed biographies of foreign artists and authors
to Lardner's <i>Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, and ed. her husband's poems.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of Sir
Timothy S., was <i>b.</i> at Field Place, near Horsham, Sussex, and <i>ed.</i> at
Brentford, Eton, and Univ. Coll., Oxf., whence for writing and circulating
a pamphlet, <i>The Necessity of Atheism</i>, he was expelled. One
immediate result of this was a difference with his <i>f.</i>, which was
deepened into a permanent breach by his marriage in the following
year to Harriet Westbrook, the pretty and lively <i>dau.</i> of a retired
innkeeper. The next three years were passed in wandering about
from place to place in Ireland, Wales, the Lake District, and other
parts of the kingdom, and in the composition of <i>Queen Mab</i> (1813),
the poet's first serious work. Before the end of that period he had
separated from his wife, for which various reasons have been assigned,
one being her previous desertion of him, and the discovery
on his part of imperfect sympathy between them; the principal one,
however, being that he had conceived a violent passion for Mary
Wollstonecraft Godwin (<i>see</i> <a href='#SHELLEY_MRS_MARY_WOLLSTONECRAFT_GODWIN_1797_1851'>Shelley, Mrs. M.W.</a>), <i>dau.</i> of<a href='#GODWIN_WILLIAM_1756_1836'> William
Godwin</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), with whom he eloped to Italy in 1814, and whom he
<i>m.</i> in 1816, his first wife having drowned herself. The custody of his
two children, whom he had left with their mother, was refused him
by the Court of Chancery. In Switzerland he had made the acquaintance
of Byron, with whom he afterwards lived in intimacy in Italy.
Returning to England in 1815 he wrote his first really great poem,
<i>Alastor</i> (1816), followed by the <i>Hymn to Intellectual Beauty</i>, <i>Prince
Athanase</i>, <i>Rosalind and Helen</i>, and <i>Laon and Cythna</i>, afterwards
called the <i>Revolt of Islam</i> (1817). In 1818 he left England never to
return, and went to Italy, and in the next two years&mdash;while at<a name='Page_341'></a>
Rome&mdash;produced his two greatest works, the tragedy of <i>The Cenci</i>
(1819) and <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> (1820). He removed to Venice in
1820 in the company of Byron, and there wrote <i>Julian and Maddalo</i>,
a poetic record of discussions between them. <i>Epipsychidion</i>, <i>Hellas</i>,
and <i>Adonais</i>, a lament for Keats, were all produced in 1821. After
a short residence at Pisa he went to Lerici on the Gulf of Spezzia,
where he indulged in his favourite recreation of boating, and here
on July 8, 1823, he went, in company with a friend, Mr. Williams,
on that fatal expedition which cost him his life. His body was
cast ashore about a fortnight later, and burnt, in accordance
with the quarantine law of the country, on a pyre in the presence
of Byron, Leigh Hunt, and Trelawny. His ashes were carefully
preserved and buried in the Protestant cemetery at Rome near
those of Keats. The character of S. is a singularly compounded
one. By the unanimous testimony of his friends, it was remarkable
for gentleness, purity, generosity, and strong affection: on
the other hand he appears to have had very inadequate conceptions
of duty and responsibility, and from his childhood seems to
have been in revolt against authority of every kind. The charge of
Atheism rests chiefly on <i>Mab</i>, the work of a boy, printed by him for
private circulation, and to some extent repudiated as personal
opinion. As a poet he stands in the front rank: in lyrical gift,
shown in <i>Prometheus</i>, <i>Hellas</i>, and some of his shorter poems, such as
&quot;The Skylark,&quot; he is probably unsurpassed, and in his <i>Cenci</i> he exhibits
dramatic power of a high order. Among his shorter poems
are some which reach perfection, such as the sonnet on &quot;Ozymandias,&quot;
&quot;Music when soft voices die,&quot; &quot;I arise from dreams of
thee,&quot; &quot;When the lamp is shattered,&quot; the &quot;Ode to the West
Wind,&quot; and &quot;O world! O life! O time!&quot; During his short life of
30 years he was, not unnaturally, the object of much severe judgment,
and his poetic power even was recognised by only a few.
Posterity has taken a more lenient view of his serious errors of conduct,
while according to his genius a shining place among the
immortals.</p>

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of Thomas
S., owner of a small estate at Hales Owen, Shropshire. At this
place, called the Leasowes, the poet was <i>b.</i> In 1732 he went to Oxf.
On his father's death he retired to the Leasowes where he passed his
time, and ran through his means in transforming it into a marvel of
landscape gardening, visited by strangers from all parts of the kingdom.
The works of S. consist of poems and prose essays. Of the
former two, <i>The Schoolmistress</i>, a humorous imitation of Spenser,
with many quaint and tender touches, and the <i>Pastoral Ballad</i> in four
parts, perhaps the best of its kind in the language, survive. The
essays also display good sense and a pointed and graceful style.
The last years of S. were clouded by financial embarrassments and
perhaps also by disappointed affections. After his death his works,
were <i>coll.</i> and <i>pub.</i> by Dodsley<a name='Page_342'></a>.</p><br />

<a name='SHERIDAN_RICHARD_BRINSLEY_1751_1816'></a><p><b>SHERIDAN, RICHARD BRINSLEY (1751-1816).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist
and orator, <i>b.</i> in Dublin, the <i>s.</i> of an actor, was <i>ed.</i> at Harrow. In
1772 he eloped with Miss Linley, a famous singer, went with her to
France, fought two duels, and <i>m.</i> her in 1773. S. has a reputation
of the highest in two distinct walks, those of the dramatist and the
Parliamentary orator. By his three great comedies, <i>The Rivals</i> (1775),
<i>The School for Scandal</i> (1777), and <i>The Critic</i> (1779), he raised himself
to the first place among the writers of the comedy of manners;
and by his speeches, specially those in support of the impeachment
of Warren Hastings, he has a position among the greatest of Parliamentary
orators. Unfortunately he had little turn for business, and
too great a love of pleasure and conviviality, which led to lifelong
pecuniary embarrassment, completed by the destruction by fire of
Drury Lane Theatre, of which he had become proprietor. As a
politician S. supported the Whig party, and held the offices of Under-Sec.
for Foreign Affairs, Sec. to the Treasury, and Treasurer of the
Navy. He was also confidential adviser to George IV. when Prince
of Wales, but like everybody else who had to do with him suffered
from the ingratitude of &quot;the first gentleman in Europe.&quot; The accounts
long prevalent of the poverty and misery of his last years
have been shown to be greatly exaggerated, though he was in
reduced circumstances. As a dramatist S. shines in the construction
of amusing situations, and in a sparkling flow of witty dialogue
which never flags. His only other play was <i>Pizarro</i> (1799), a
patriotic melodrama.</p>

joined the Roman Catholic Church, and going to London
wrote for the stage, producing 39 plays. His talents and his religion
recommended him to Queen Henrietta Maria, and he appears to
have led a fairly prosperous life until the interdict of plays by Parliament
<a name='Page_343'></a>in 1642. In the Civil War he bore arms on the Royalist
side, and during the Commonwealth he returned to his occupation
of schoolmaster. The Restoration does not appear to have improved
his fortunes much; he was burnt out in the great fire of 1666,
and very soon afterwards he and his wife <i>d.</i> on the same day. The
plays of S. include <i>The Traitor</i> (1631), <i>The Cardinal</i> (1641), <i>The
Gamester</i> (1633), <i>Hyde Park</i> (1632), and <i>The Lady of Pleasure</i> (1635).
He also wrote poems, including the well-known lines beginning
&quot;The Glories of our mortal State.&quot; S. has fancy, liveliness, and
the style of a gentleman, but he lacks depth and interest. He is less

a Quaker, he joined the Church of England. His first, and by far
his best book, <i>John Inglesant</i>, appeared in 1881, and at once made
him famous. Though deficient in its structure as a story, and not
appealing to the populace, it fascinates by the charm of its style and
the &quot;dim religious light&quot; by which it is suffused, as well as by the
striking scenes occasionally depicted. His other novels, <i>The Little
Schoolmaster Mark</i>, <i>Sir Percival</i>, <i>The Countess Eve</i>, and <i>A Teacher of
the Violin</i>, though with some of the same characteristics, had no
success comparable to his first. S. also wrote an essay, <i>The Platonism

<a name='SIDNEY_or_SYDNEY_ALGERNON_1622_1683'></a><p><b>SIDNEY, or SYDNEY, ALGERNON (1622-1683).</b>
&mdash;Political
writer, <i>s.</i> of the 2nd Earl of Leicester, and grand-nephew of Sir
Philip S., in his youth travelled on the Continent, served against the
Irish Rebels, and on the outbreak of the Civil War, on the side of the
Parliament. He was one of the judges on the trial of Charles I., and
though he did not attend, he thoroughly approved of the sentence.
He opposed the assumption of the supreme power by Cromwell.
After the Restoration he lived on the Continent, but receiving a
pardon, returned in 1677 to England. He, however, retained the
republican principles which he had all his life advocated, fell under
the suspicion of the Court, and was in 1683, on the discovery of the
Rye House Plot, condemned to death on entirely insufficient
evidence, and beheaded on Tower Hill, December 7, 1683. Though
no charge of personal venality has been substantiated, yet it appears
to be certain that he received money from the French King for using
his influence against war between the two countries, his object being
to prevent Charles II. from obtaining command of the war supplies.
S. was deeply versed in political theory, and wrote <i>Discourses concerning
Government</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1698<a name='Page_344'></a>.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet and romancist,
<i>s.</i> of Sir Henry S., Deputy of Ireland, and Pres. of Wales, <i>b.</i> at the
family seat of Penshurst, and <i>ed.</i> at Shrewsbury School and Oxf.
He was at the French Court on the fateful August 24, 1572&mdash;the
massacre of St. Bartholomew&mdash;but left Paris soon thereafter and
went to Germany and Italy. In 1576 he was with his <i>f.</i> in Ireland,
and the next year went on missions to the Elector Palatine and the
Emperor Rudolf II. When his father's Irish policy was called in
question, he wrote an able defence of it. He became the friend of
Spenser, who dedicated to him his <i>Shepherd's Calendar</i>. In 1580 he
lost the favour of the Queen by remonstrating against her proposed
marriage with the Duke of Anjou. His own marriage with a <i>dau.</i> of
Sir Francis Walsingham took place in 1583. In 1585 he was engaged
in the war in the Low Countries, and met his death at Zutphen
from a wound in the thigh. His death was commemorated by
Spenser in his <i>Astrophel</i>. S. has always been considered as the type
of English chivalry; and his extraordinary contemporary reputation
rested on his personal qualities of nobility and generosity. His
writings consist of his famous pastoral romance of <i>Arcadia</i>, his
sonnets <i>Astrophel and Stella</i>, and his <i>Apologie for Poetrie</i>, afterwards
called <i>Defence of Poesie</i>. The <i>Arcadia</i> was originally written for the
amusement of his sister, afterwards Countess of Pembroke, the
&quot;Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother,&quot; of Ben Jonson. Though its
interest now is chiefly historical, it enjoyed an extraordinary popularity
for a century after its appearance, and had a marked influence
on the immediately succeeding literature. It was written in 1580-81
but not <i>pub.</i> until 1590, and is a medley of poetical prose, full of conceits,
with occasional verse interspersed. His <i>Defence of Poesie</i>,
written in reply to <a href='#GOSSON_STEPHEN_1554_1624'>Gosson</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), is in simple and vigorous English.
S. also made a translation of the Psalms.</p>

He then for some time tried poetry, but without any distinct
success except occasionally in <i>Southern Passages and Pictures</i>
(1839). But in fiction, which he began in 1833 with <i>Martin Faber</i>,
he was more successful, though rather an imitator of Cooper. <i>The
Yemassee</i> (1835) is generally considered his best novel. He was less
happy in his attempts at historical romance, such as <i>Count Julian</i>
and <i>The Damsel of Darien</i>. During the war, in which he was naturally
a strong partisan of the South, he was ruined, and his library
was burned; and from these disasters he never recovered. He had
<a name='Page_345'></a>a high repute as a journalist, orator, and lecturer. He was the first

&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Norfolk, and
<i>ed.</i> at Oxf. and Camb., of both of which he was <i>cr.</i> Poet Laureate,
and perhaps held the same office under the King. He was appointed
tutor to Henry VIII., and notwithstanding his sharp tongue, enjoyed
some favour at Court. In 1498 he entered the Church, and
became Rector of Diss in his native county. Hitherto he seems to
have produced some translations only, but about this time he
appears to have struck upon the vein which he was to work with
such vigour and popularity. He turned his attention to abuses in
Church and State, which he lashed with caustic satire, conveyed in
short doggerel rhyming lines peculiar to himself, in which jokes,
slang, invectives, and Latin quotations rush out pell-mell. His
best works in this line are <i>Why come ye not to Court?</i> and <i>Colin Clout</i>,
both directed against the clergy, and the former against Wolsey in
particular. Piqued at his inconstancy (for S. had previously
courted him) the Cardinal would have imprisoned him, had he not
taken sanctuary in Westminster, where he remained until his death.
Other works of his are <i>The Tunning</i> (brewing) <i>of Elynor Rummynge</i>,
a coarsely humorous picture of low life, and the tender and fanciful
<i>Death of Philip Sparrow</i>, the lament of a young lady over her pet
bird killed by a cat.</p><br />

<i>f.</i> <i>d.</i> shortly before his birth. The first and only adventure in his
tranquil life was his being kidnapped by gipsies. After being at the
Grammar School of Kirkcaldy, he went to the Univ. of Glasgow,
whence he proceeded to Oxf. On the conclusion of his Univ. course
he returned to Kirkcaldy, going subsequently to Edinburgh, where he
was soon recognised as a man of unusual intellect. In 1751 he was
appointed to the Chair of Logic at Glasgow, which he next year
exchanged for that of Moral Philosophy, and in 1759 he <i>pub.</i> his
<i>Theory of the Moral Sentiments</i>. He received in 1762 the degree of
LL.D. from his Univ., and two years later resigned his chair and
<a name='Page_347'></a>became travelling tutor to the young Duke of Buccleuch, accompanying
him to the Continent. He remained for nearly a year in
Paris, and made the acquaintance of the brilliant circle of <i>savans</i> in
that city. Returning to Kirkcaldy in 1766 he lived there with his
mother for nearly ten years in retirement and close study, the
results of which were given to the world in 1776 in the publication of
his epoch-making work, <i>Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations</i> (1776). This book may be said to have founded
the science of political economy, and to have created a new department
of literature; and very few works have, to the same extent,
influenced the practical history of the world. In 1778 S. was made
a Commissioner of Customs, and settled in Edinburgh; and in 1787 he
was elected Lord Rector of the Univ. of Glasgow. In addition to
the works above mentioned, he wrote various essays on philosophical
subjects, and an account of the last days of David Hume. The
style of his works was plain and lucid, and he had a remarkable
faculty of apt illustration.</p><br />

<a name='SMITH_ALBERT_1816_1860'></a><p><b>SMITH, ALBERT (1816-1860).</b>
&mdash;Humorous writer, studied
medicine, and for a short time assisted his <i>f.</i> in practice. He was
one of the original contributors to <i>Punch</i>, and among his books are
<i>The Adventures of Mr. Ledbury</i> and <i>The Scattergood Family</i>. He
also lectured and gave entertainments, including <i>The Ascent of Mont

<a name='SMITH_ALEXANDER_1830_1867'></a><p><b>SMITH, ALEXANDER (1830-1867).</b>
&mdash;Poet and essayist, <i>s.</i>
of a Paisley pattern-designer, at first followed the same occupation
in Glasgow, but having become known as a poet of promise was, in
1854, appointed Sec. of Edin. Univ. After contributing to the
<i>Glasgow Citizen</i> he <i>pub.</i> <i>A Life Drama</i> (1853), which received much
admiration. Thereafter appeared <i>War Sonnets</i> (in conjunction,
with <a href='#DOBELL_SYDNEY_THOMPSON_1824_1874'>S. Dobell</a>, <i>q.v.</i>), <i>City Poems</i> (1857), and <i>Edwin of Deira</i> (1861).
In prose he wrote <i>Dreamthorpe</i> (essays), <i>A Summer in Skye</i>, and two
novels, <i>Alfred Hagart's Household</i> and <i>Miss Dona M'Quarrie</i>. His
poems were in a rich and glowing style, but by some good judges
were held to show fancy rather than imagination. He belonged to
what was called the &quot;spasmodic&quot; school of poetry.</p><br />

<a name='SMITH_MRS_CHARLOTTE_TURNER_1749_1806'></a><p><b>SMITH, MRS. CHARLOTTE (TURNER) (1749-1806).</b>
&mdash;Was
<i>m.</i> at 15 to a West Indian merchant, who by a series of misfortunes
and imprudences was reduced from affluence to poverty. She had
in her youth shown considerable promise as a poetess, and in her misfortunes
she was able to maintain herself and her family by her pen.
In addition to a poem, <i>Beachy Head</i>, and sonnets, she wrote several
novels of more than usual merit, including <i>Emmeline</i> (1788), and, her
best work, <i>The Old English Manor House</i>.</p><br />

&mdash;Humorists,
<i>s.</i> of a London lawyer who was solicitor to the Board
of Ordnance. James succeeded his <i>f.</i>; Horace became a successful
stockbroker. Both brothers were distinguished for brilliant wit and
humour. Their first great hit was <i>Rejected Addresses</i> (1812), extremely
clever parodies on leading contemporary poets. To this
<i>jeu d'esprit</i> James contributed among others imitations of Wordsworth,
Coleridge, and Crabbe, while Horace's share included Scott
<a name='Page_348'></a>and Moore. James <i>pub.</i> little more, but anonymously gave Charles
Matthews assistance in his entertainments. Horace <i>pub.</i> several
novels which, with perhaps the exception of <i>Brambletye House</i>, are
now forgotten. He also wrote <i>The Address to a Mummy</i>, a remarkable
poem in which wit and true sentiment are admirably combined.
Both brothers were highly esteemed not only for their social qualities,
but for their benevolence and goodness of heart.</p><br />

<a name='SMITH_SYDNEY_1771_1845'></a><p><b>SMITH, SYDNEY (1771-1845).</b>
&mdash;Miscellaneous writer, <i>b.</i> at
Woodford, Essex, the <i>s.</i> of a gentleman of independent means, and <i>ed.</i>
at Winchester and Oxf., took orders 1794, becoming curate of Amesbury.
He came to Edinburgh as tutor to a gentleman's <i>s.</i>, was introduced
to the circle of brilliant young Whigs there, and assisted
in founding the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. He then went to London, where
he was for a time preacher at the Foundling Hospital, and lectured
on moral philosophy at the Royal Institution. His brilliant wit and
general ability made him a favourite in society, while by his power
of clear and cogent argument he exercised a strong influence on the
course of politics. His <i>Plymley Letters</i> did much to advance the cause
of Catholic emancipation. He received various preferments, and became
a canon of St. Paul's. In politics he was a Whig, in his Church
views an Erastian; and in the defence of his principles he was honest
and courageous. Though not remarkable for religious devotion he
was a hard-working and, according to his lights, useful country
parson. By the death of a younger brother he in his later years
came into a considerable fortune.</p><br />

<a name='SMITH_WALTER_CHALMERS_1824_1908'></a><p><b>SMITH, WALTER CHALMERS (1824-1908).</b>
&mdash;<i>B.</i> in Aberdeen
and <i>ed.</i> there and at Edin., was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland
at Orwell, Glasgow, and Edinburgh successively, a distinguished
preacher and a man of kindly nature and catholic sympathies. He
attained considerable reputation as a poet. Among his works are
<i>The Bishop's Walk</i> (1861), <i>Olrig Grange</i> (1872), <i>Hilda among the
Broken Gods</i> (1878), <i>Raban</i> (1880), <i>Kildrostan</i> (1884), and <i>A Heretic</i>
(1890). Some of these were written under the names of
&quot;Orwell&quot;

compiled or ed. many useful works of reference, including <i>Dictionary
of Greek and Roman Antiquities</i> (1842), and dictionaries of the Bible,
of Christian Antiquities, and Christian Biography, etc., also various
school series and educational handbooks, including <i>The Classical

&mdash;Theologian
and Semitic scholar, <i>s.</i> of the Free Church minister of Keig, Aberdeenshire,
studied for the ministry of that Church. In 1870 he was
appointed Prof. of Hebrew, etc., in its coll. at Aberdeen, a position
which he had to resign on account of his advanced critical views.
He became joint ed. of <i>The Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, and in 1883
Prof. of Arabic at Camb. S. was a man of brilliant and versatile
talents, a mathematician as well as a scholar, somewhat uncompromising
and aggressive in the exposition and defence of his views.<a name='Page_349'></a>
His works include <i>The Old Testament in the Jewish Church</i> (1881),
and <i>The Religion of the Semites</i> (1889).</p><br />

<a name='SMOLLETT_TOBIAS_GEORGE_1721_1771'></a><p><b>SMOLLETT, TOBIAS GEORGE (1721-1771).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, 2nd
<i>s.</i> of Archibald S., of Dalquhurn, Dumbartonshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Glasgow,
proceeded to London in 1739 with the view of having a tragedy,
<i>The Regicide</i>, put on the stage, in which, however, he failed. In
this disappointment he took service as surgeon's mate on one of the
vessels of the Carthagena expedition, 1741, an experience which he
turned to account in his novels. On his return he settled in London,
and endeavoured to acquire practice as a physician, but was not
very successful, and having discovered where his talent lay, he
thenceforth devoted himself to literature. <i>Roderick Random</i> appeared
in 1748, <i>The History of an Atom</i> (1749), <i>Peregrine Pickle</i> in
1751, <i>Ferdinand, Count Fathom</i> in 1753, <i>Sir Lancelot Greaves</i> in 1766,
and <i>Humphrey Clinker</i>, generally considered his best novel, in 1770.
Besides these works, however, he translated Voltaire, wrote a <i>History
of England</i> in continuation of Hume's, an <i>Ode to Independence</i>,
travels and satires, and contributed to various periodicals. He was
repeatedly involved in acrimonious controversy, and on one occasion
fined and imprisoned for a libel, which, with various private
misfortunes, embittered his life, and he <i>d.</i> disappointed and worn out
near Leghorn. Had he lived four years longer he would have succeeded
to his grandfather's estate of Bonhill. The novels of S. display
great narrative power, and he has a remarkable comic vein of
a broad type, which enables him to present ludicrous scenes and
circumstances with great effect. There is, however, a strong infusion
of coarseness in his treatment of his subjects.</p><br />

<a name='SOMERVILLE_MRS_MARY_FAIRFAX_1780_1872'></a><p><b>SOMERVILLE, MRS. MARY (FAIRFAX) (1780-1872).</b>

G. Fairfax, <i>b.</i> at Jedburgh, was twice <i>m.</i>, first to Mr. Greig, an
officer in the Russian Navy, and second to her cousin Dr. William S.
Although she had early manifested a taste for study, and specially
for science, she had, until after the death of her first husband, little
opportunity of following out her favourite subjects. With Dr. S.,
who was in full sympathy with her scientific tastes, she went to
reside in London, and there her talents made her known in scientific
circles. In 1823 she was requested by Lord Brougham to popularise
the <i>Mechanique Celeste</i> of La Place. This she did with great success,
publishing her work as <i>The Celestial Mechanism of the Heavens</i>
(1830). She also <i>pub.</i> <i>The Connection of the Physical Sciences</i> (1834),
and other works. She received a pension from Government, and <i>d.</i>

<a name='SOTHEBY_WILLIAM_1757_1833'></a><p><b>SOTHEBY, WILLIAM (1757-1833).</b>
&mdash;Poet and translator,
belonged to a good family, and was <i>ed.</i> at Harrow. In early life he
was in the army. He <i>pub.</i> a few dramas and books of poems, which
had no great popularity, and are now forgotten; his reputation
<a name='Page_350'></a>rests upon his admirable translations of the <i>Oberon</i> of Wieland, the
<i>Georgics</i> of Virgil, and the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>. The last two were
begun when he was upwards of 70, but he lived to complete them.
His <i>Georgics</i> is considered one of the best translations from the
classics in the language.</p><br />

&mdash;Divine, <i>s.</i> of a London
merchant, was <i>b.</i> at Hackney, and <i>ed.</i> at Westminster School and
Oxf., where in 1660 he was appointed Univ. Orator. He became
domestic chaplain to the Lord Chancellor Clarendon, and in 1663
the degree of D.D. was conferred upon him. After accompanying
an embassy to Poland he became Rector of Islip, and a chaplain
to Charles II. Thereafter he steadily declined higher preferment,
including the bishopric of Rochester. He was opposed to the
Romanising measures of James II., but owing to his views as to the
duty of passive obedience he declined to associate himself in any
way with the Revolution, to which nevertheless he submitted. He
was an expert controversialist, but it is chiefly by his sermons,
which are among the classics of English divinity, that he is remembered.
He has the reputation of being the wittiest of English
preachers, and this characteristic is sometimes present to a degree
not quite suitable to the subjects treated.</p><br />

law at the Middle Temple. Afterwards he entered the army and
saw service. He wrote ten plays, of which two were long acted and
are still remembered, <i>The Fatal Marriage</i> (1694) and <i>Oroonoko</i> (1696),
in the latter of which he appeals passionately against the slave-trade.
Unlike most preceding dramatists he was a practical man,
succeeded in his theatrical management, and retired on a fortune.
Other plays are <i>The Loyal Brother</i> (1682), <i>The Disappointment</i> (1684), <i>The Wives' Excuse</i> (1692), <i>The Spartan Dame</i> (1719), etc.</p><br />

<a name='SOUTHEY_ROBERT_1774_1843'></a><p><b>SOUTHEY, ROBERT (1774-1843).</b>
&mdash;Poet, biographer, etc.,
<i>s.</i> of an unsuccessful linen-draper in Bristol, where he was <i>b.</i>, was
sent to Westminster School, and in 1792 went to Oxf. His friendship
with Coleridge began in 1794, and with him he joined in the
scheme of a &quot;pantisocracy&quot; (<i>see</i> <a href='#COLERIDGE_SAMUEL_TAYLOR_1772_1834'>Coleridge</a>). In 1795 he <i>m.</i> his first
wife, Edith Fricker, and thus became the brother-in-law of Coleridge.
Shortly afterwards he visited Spain, and in 1800 Portugal,
and laid the foundations of his thorough knowledge of the history
and literature of the Peninsula. Between these two periods of
foreign travel he had attempted the study of law, which proved
entirely uncongenial; and in 1803 he settled at Greta Hall, Keswick,
to which neighbourhood the Coleridges had also come. Here he set
himself to a course of indefatigable literary toil which only ended
<a name='Page_351'></a>with his life. <i>Thalaba</i> had appeared in 1801, and there followed
<i>Madoc</i> (1805), <i>The Curse of Kehama</i> (1810), <i>Roderic, the Last of the
Goths</i> (1814), and <i>A Vision of Judgment</i> (1821); and in prose a <i>History
of Brazil</i>, Lives of Nelson (1813), Wesley (1820), and Bunyan
(1830), <i>The Book of the Church</i> (1824), <i>History of the Peninsular War</i>
(1823-32), <i>Naval History</i>, and <i>The Doctor</i> (1834-37). In addition to
this vast amount of work he had been from 1808 a constant contributor
to the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. In 1839 when he was failing both in
body and mind he <i>m.</i>, as his second wife, Miss Caroline Ann Bowles,
who had for 20 years been his intimate friend, and by whom his few
remaining years were soothed. Though the name of S. still bulks
somewhat largely in the history of our literature, his works, with a
few exceptions, are now little read, and those of them (his longer
poems, <i>Thalaba</i> and <i>Kehama</i>) on which he himself based his hopes of
lasting fame, least of all. To this result their length, remoteness
from living interests, and the impression that their often splendid
diction is rather eloquence than true poetry, have contributed.
Some of his shorter poems, <i>e.g.</i>, &quot;The Holly Tree,&quot; and &quot;The Battle
of Blenheim&quot; still live, but his fame now rests on his vigorous prose
and especially on his classic <i>Life of Nelson</i>. Like Wordsworth and
Coleridge, S. began life as a democratic visionary, and was strongly
influenced by the French Revolution, but gradually cooled down into
a pronounced Tory. He was himself greater and better than any of
his works, his life being a noble record of devotion to duty and unselfish
benevolence. He held the office of Poet Laureate from 1813,
and had a pension from Government. He declined a baronetcy.</p>

St. Faith's, Norfolk, of good Roman Catholic family, and <i>ed.</i> at
Douay, Paris, and Rome, he became a Jesuit, and showed such
learning and ability as to be appointed Prefect of the English Coll.
In 1586 he came to England with Garnett, the superior of the
English province, and became chaplain to the Countess of Arundel.
His being in England for more than 40 days then rendered him
liable to the punishment of death and disembowelment, and in 1592
he was apprehended and imprisoned in the Tower for three years,
during which he was tortured 13 times. He was then put on trial
and executed, February 22, 1595. He was the author of <i>St. Peter's
Complaint</i> and <i>The Burning Babe</i>, a short poem of great imaginative
power, and of several prose religious works, including <i>St. Mary
Magdalene's Teares</i>, <i>A Short Rule of Good Life</i>, <i>The Triumphs over
Death</i>, etc.</p><br />

was for some years in the Colonial Office. He devoted himself to
the ed. of Bacon's works, and the endeavour to clear his character
against the aspersions of Macaulay and others. The former was
done in conjunction with Ellis and Heath, his own being much the
largest share in their great ed. (1861-74); and the latter, so far as
possible, in <i>The Life and Letters</i>, entirely his own. In 1878 he
<a name='Page_352'></a>brought out an abridged <i>Life and Times of Francis Bacon</i>. He
strongly combated the theory that B. was the author of Shakespeare's
plays. His death was caused by his being run over by a
cab. He enjoyed the friendship of many of his greatest contemporaries,
including Carlyle, Tennyson, and Fitzgerald.</p><br />

for history and antiquities, and wrote a <i>History of Great Britain</i>
(1611), which was long the best in existence, in collecting material
for which he had assistance from Cotton, Spelman, and other investigators.
He also <i>pub.</i> useful maps of Great Britain and Ireland,
and of various counties, etc. In 1616 appeared his <i>Cloud of Witnesses

History of the English Councils</i> (1639), and <i>Tenures by Knight-service</i>

and held various preferments, including a prebend at Durham, and
was Prof. of Poetry at Oxf. He wrote an <i>Essay on Pope's Odyssey</i>,
which gained for him the friendship of the poet, of whose conversation
he made notes, collecting likewise anecdotes of him and of other
celebrities which were <i>pub.</i> in 1820, and are of great value, inasmuch
as they preserve much matter illustrative of the literary history of
the 18th century which would otherwise have been lost.</p><br />

<a name='SPENCER_HERBERT_1820_1903'></a><p><b>SPENCER, HERBERT (1820-1903).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher, <i>b.</i> at
Derby, the <i>s.</i> of a teacher, from whom, and from his uncle, mentioned
below, he received most of his education. His immediate family
circle was strongly Dissenting in its theological atmosphere, his <i>f.</i>,
originally a Methodist, having become a Quaker, while his mother
remained a Wesleyan. At 13 he was sent to the care of his uncle,
Thomas S., a clergyman, near Bath, but a Radical and anti-corn-law
agitator. Declining a Univ. career he became a school assistant,
but shortly after accepted a situation under the engineer of the
London and Birmingham railway, in which he remained until the
great railway crisis of 1846 threw him out of employment. Previous
to this he had begun to write political articles in the <i>Nonconformist</i>;
he now resolved to devote himself to journalism, and in
1848 was appointed sub-ed. of the <i>Economist</i>. Thereafter he became
more and more absorbed in the consideration of the problems of
sociology and the development of the doctrine of evolution as applied
<a name='Page_353'></a>thereto, gradually leading up to the completion of a system of
philosophy which was the work of his life. His fundamental proposition
is that society, like the individual, is an organism subject to
evolution, and the scope of this idea is gradually expanded so as
to embrace in its sweep the whole range of cognisible phenomena.
Among the books which he <i>pub.</i> in exposition of his views
may be mentioned <i>Social Statics</i> (1850), <i>Principles of Psychology</i>
(1855), <i>First Principles</i> (1862), <i>Principles of Biology</i> (1867),
<i>Data of Ethics</i> (1879), <i>Principles of Sociology</i> (1877), <i>Political Institutions</i>
(1882), and <i>Man versus the State</i> (1884). His works have
been translated into most European languages&mdash;some of them into
Chinese and Japanese. The most characteristic qualities of S. as a
thinker are his powers of generalisation and analysis. He left an
autobiography, in which he subjects his own personality to analysis
with singular detachment of mind.</p>

He wrote graceful <i>vers de societ&eacute;</i>, made translations from B&uuml;rger, and

<a name='SPENSER_EDMUND_1552_1599'></a><p><b>SPENSER, EDMUND (1552?-1599).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i> in East
Smithfield, London, the <i>s.</i> of John S., described as gentleman and
journeyman in the art of cloth-making, who had come to London
from Lancashire. In 1561 the poet was sent to Merchant Taylor's
School, then newly opened, and in 1569 he proceeded to Pembroke
Hall, Camb., as a sizar, taking his degree in 1576. Among his
friends there were Edward Kirke, who ed. the <i>Shepheard's Calendar</i>,
and Gabriel Harvey, the critic. While still at school he had contributed
14 sonnet-visions to Van de Noot's <i>Theatre for Worldlings</i>
(1569). On leaving the Univ. S. went to the north, probably to
visit his relations in Lancashire, and in 1578, through his friend
Harvey, he became known to Leicester and his brother-in-law,
Philip Sidney. The next year, 1579, saw the publication of <i>The
Shepheard's Calendar</i> in 12 eclogues. It was dedicated to Sidney,
who had become his friend and patron, and was received with acclamation,
all who had ears for poetry perceiving that a new and
great singer had arisen. The following year S. was appointed sec.
to Lord Grey of Wilton, Deputy for Ireland, a strict Puritan, and
accompanied him to Ireland. At the same time he appears to have
begun the <i>Faerie Queen</i>. In 1581 he was appointed Registrar of
Chancery, and received a grant of the Abbey and Castle of Enniscorthy,
which was followed in 1586 by a grant of the Castle of Kilcolman
in County Cork, a former possession of the Earls of Desmond
with 3000 acres attached. Simultaneously, however, a heavy blow
fell upon him in the death of Sidney at the Battle of Zutphen. The
loss of this dear friend he commemorated in his lament of <i>Astrophel</i>.
In 1590 he was visited by Sir Walter Raleigh, who persuaded him to
come to England, and presented him to the Queen, from whom he
received a pension of &pound;50, which does not, however, appear to have
<a name='Page_354'></a>been regularly paid, and on the whole his experiences of the Court
did not yield him much satisfaction. In the same year his reputation
as a poet was vastly augmented by the publication of the first
three books of the <i>Faerie Queen</i>, dedicated to Elizabeth. The enthusiasm
with which they were received led the publisher to bring
out a collection of other writings of S. under the general title of
<i>Complaints</i>, and including <i>Mother Hubbard's Tale</i> (a satire on the
Court and on the conflict then being waged between the old faith
and the new), <i>Teares of the Muses</i>, and <i>The Ruins of Time</i>.
Having seen these ventures launched, S. returned to Kilcolman and
wrote <i>Colin Clout's come Home Again</i>, one of the brightest and most
vigorous of his poems, not, however, <i>pub.</i> until 1595. In the following
year appeared his <i>Four Hymns</i>, two on <i>Love and Beauty</i> and two
on <i>Heavenly Love and Beauty</i>, and the <i>Prothalamion</i> on the marriage
of two daughters of the Earl of Worcester. He also <i>pub.</i> in prose
his <i>View of Ireland</i>, a work full of shrewd observation and practical
statesmanship. In 1594 he was <i>m.</i> to Elizabeth Boyle, whom he
had courted in <i>Amoretti</i>, and his union with whom he now celebrated
in the magnificent <i>Epithalamion</i>, by many regarded as his most perfect
poem. In 1595 he returned to England, taking with him the
second part of the <i>Faerie Queen</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1596. In 1598 he was made
Sheriff of Cork, and in the same year his fortunes suffered a final
eclipse. The rebellion of Tyrone broke out, his castle was burned,
and in the conflagration his youngest child, an infant, perished, he
himself with his wife and remaining children escaping with difficulty.
He joined the President, Sir T. Norris, who sent him with despatches
to London, where he suddenly <i>d.</i> on January 16, 1599, as was long believed
in extreme destitution. This, however, happily appears to be
at least doubtful. He was buried in Westminster Abbey near
Chaucer, and a monument was erected to his memory in 1620 by the
Countess of Dorset.</p>

<p>The position of S. in English poetry is below Chaucer, Shakespeare,
and Milton only. The first far excels him in narrative and
constructive power and in humour, and the last in austere grandeur
of conception; but for richness and beauty of imagination and exquisite
sweetness of music he is unsurpassed except by Shakespeare.
He has been called the poets' poet, a title which he well merits, not
only by virtue of the homage which all the more imaginative poets
have yielded him, but because of the almost unequalled influence he
has exercised upon the whole subsequent course and expression of
English poetry, which he enriched with the stanza which bears his
name, and which none since him have used with more perfect
mastery. His faults are prolixity, indirectness, and want of constructive
power, and consequently the sustained sweetness and
sumptuousness of his verse are apt to cloy. His great work, the
<i>Faerie Queen</i>, is but a gorgeous fragment, six books out of a projected
twelve; but probably few or none of its readers have regretted
its incompleteness. In it Protestantism and Puritanism receive
their most poetic and imaginative presentation and vindication.</p>

&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of John
S., minister of Midcalder and Superintendent of Lothian. Entering
the Church he gained the favour of James VI., and was his chief instrument
in his endeavours to restore Episcopal church-government
in Scotland. He became Archbishop successively of Glasgow and
St. Andrews, and in 1635 Lord Chancellor of Scotland. On the
rising caused by the introduction of the service-book, he had to flee
from Scotland, and was excommunicated by the General Assembly
(1638). He wrote a <i>History of the Church and State of Scotland</i>, <i>pub.</i>
1655. It is, of course, written from the Episcopalian standpoint, as
Calderwood's is from the Presbyterian.</p><br />

elegy on his sister.</p><br />

<a name='SPRAT_THOMAS_1635_1713'></a><p><b>SPRAT, THOMAS (1635-1713).</b>
&mdash;Divine and writer of
memoirs, <i>b.</i> at Beaminster, Dorset, <i>ed.</i> at Oxf., was a mathematician,
and one of the group of scientific men among whom the Royal
Society, of which he was one of the first members and the historian,
had its origin. He wrote a Life of his friend Cowley the poet, and an
account of Young's plot for the restoration of James II. His <i>History
of the Royal Society</i> is his principal work, but he also wrote poems,
and had a high reputation as a preacher. His literary style gives
him a distinguished place among English writers. He held various,
high preferments, and <i>d.</i> Bishop of Rochester.</p><br />

<a name='SPURGEON_CHARLES_HADDON_1834_1892'></a><p><b>SPURGEON, CHARLES HADDON (1834-1892).</b>
&mdash;<i>B.</i> at
Kelvedon, Essex, left the Independents and joined the Baptist communion
and became, at the age of 20, pastor of New Park Street
Chapel, London, where he attained an unprecedented popularity. In
1859 the Metropolitan Tabernacle was erected for him. He was a
decided Calvinist in his theological views, and was strongly opposed
to modern critical movements. He possessed in an eminent degree
two of the great requisites of effective oratory, a magnificent voice
and a command of pure idiomatic Saxon English. His sermons,
composed and <i>pub.</i> weekly, had an enormous circulation, and were
regularly translated into several languages. In addition to his
pastoral labours he superintended an almshouse, a pastor's coll., and
an orphanage; and he was likewise a voluminous author, publishing,
<a name='Page_356'></a>in addition to his sermons, numerous works, including <i>The Treasury
of David</i> (a commentary on the Psalms).</p><br />

<a name='STANHOPE_PHILIP_HENRY_5TH_EARL_STANHOPE_1805_1875'></a><p><b>STANHOPE, PHILIP HENRY, 5TH EARL STANHOPE (1805-1875).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
was <i>b.</i> at Walmer, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf. He sat in the
House of Commons for Wootton Bassett and Hertford, held some
minor official appointments under Peel, and identified himself with
many useful measures, specially in regard to literature and art.
His writings, which are all remarkable for industrious collection of
facts, careful and impartial sifting and weighing of evidence, and a
clear, sober, and agreeable style, include <i>History of England from the
Peace of Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles</i> (1836-63), and histories of
the <i>War of the Spanish Succession</i> (1832), and of the <i>Reign of Queen
Anne</i> (1870), besides Lives of the younger Pitt (1861) and of Lord
'Chesterfield. As an author he is best known as Viscount Mahon.</p><br />

<a name='STANLEY_ARTHUR_PENRHYN_1815_1881'></a><p><b>STANLEY, ARTHUR PENRHYN (1815-1881).</b>
&mdash;Historian,
biographer, and theologian, <i>s.</i> of Edward S., Bishop of Norwich, <i>b.</i>
at Alderley, Cheshire, of which his <i>f.</i> was then rector, <i>ed.</i> at Rugby
and Oxf., became a Fellow of Univ. Coll. Taking orders in 1839 he
became Canon of Canterbury 1851, and of Christ Church 1858, and
Dean of Westminster 1864. He was also Prof. of Ecclesiastical
History at Oxf. 1856. His ecclesiastical position was Erastian and
latitudinarian, and his practical aim in Church politics comprehension.
He gave great offence to the High Church party by his championing
of Colenso, W.G. Ward, Jowett, and others, by his preaching
in the pulpits of the Church of Scotland and in other ways, and
his latitudinarianism made him equally obnoxious to many others.
On the other hand, his singular personal charm and the fascination
of his literary style secured for him a very wide popularity. He
was a prolific author, his works including <i>Life of Dr. Arnold</i> (of
Rugby) (1844), whose favourite pupil he was, and <i>Memorials of
Canterbury</i> (1854), <i>Sinai and Palestine</i> (1855), <i>Lectures on the Eastern
Church</i> (1861), <i>History of the Jewish Church</i> (1863, etc.), <i>Historical
Memorials of Westminster Abbey</i> (1867), <i>Lectures on the History of the
Church of Scotland</i> (1872), besides various commentaries. In his
historical writings he aimed rather at conveying a vivid and picturesque
general effect than at minute accuracy of detail or philosophical
views. His masterpiece is his <i>Life of Dr. Arnold</i>, which is
one of the great biographies in the language. His wife was Lady
Augusta Bruce, to whom he was <i>m.</i> in 1868.</p><br />

scholar, connected with the Derby family, <i>ed.</i> at Camb., was the
author of some poems and of a biographical <i>History of Philosophy</i>
(4 vols., 1655-62). He was learned in the classics, and translated
from the Latin and late Greek as well as from the Italian and Portuguese,

collaborated with <a href='#HOLINSHED_or_HOLLINGSHEAD_RAPHAEL_or_RALPH_d_1580'>Holinshed</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). His principal literary achievement
was a grotesquely stiff, clumsy, and prosaic translation of the
first four books of the <i>&AElig;neid</i> into English hexameters. He also
translated some of the Psalms.</p><br />

<a name='STEELE_SIR_RICHARD_1672_1729'></a><p><b>STEELE, SIR RICHARD (1672-1729).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and dramatist,
<i>s.</i> of a Dublin attorney, who <i>d.</i> when his <i>s.</i> was 5 years old, was
on the nomination of the Duke of Ormond, sent to the Charterhouse
School, where his friendship with Addison began, and thence
went to Oxf., but left without taking a degree, and enlisted in the
Horse Guards, for which he was disinherited by a rich relation. He,
however, gained the favour of his colonel, Lord Cutts, himself a poet,
and rose to the rank of captain. With the view of setting before
himself a high ideal of conduct (to which unhappily he was never
able to attain), he at this time wrote a treatise on morals entitled
<i>The Christian Hero</i> (1701). Abandoning this vein, he next produced
three comedies, <i>The Funeral, or Grief &agrave; la Mode</i> (1702), <i>The Tender
Husband</i> (1703), and <i>The Lying Lover</i> (1704). Two years later he
was appointed Gentleman Waiter to Prince George of Denmark, and
in 1707 he was made Gazetteer; and in the same year he <i>m.</i> as his
second wife Mary Scurlock, his &quot;dear Prue,&quot; who seems, however, to
have been something of a termagant. She had considerable means,
but the incorrigible extravagance of S. soon brought on embarrassment.
In 1709 he laid the foundations of his fame by starting the
<i>Tatler</i>, the first of those periodicals which are so characteristic a
literary feature of that age. In this he had the invaluable assistance
of Addison, who contributed 42 papers out of a total of 271, and
helped with others. The <i>Tatler</i> was followed by the <i>Spectator</i>, in
which Addison co-operated to a still greater extent. It was even a
greater success, and ran to 555 numbers, exclusive of a brief revival
by Addison in which S. had no part, and in its turn was followed by
the <i>Guardian</i>. It is on his essays in these that the literary fame of
S. rests. With less refinement and delicacy of wit than Addison, he
had perhaps more knowledge of life, and a wider sympathy, and like
him he had a sincere desire for the reformation of morals and
manners. In the keen political strife of the times he fought stoutly
and honestly on the Whig side, one result of which was that he lost
his office of Gazetteer, and was in 1714 expelled from the House of
Commons to which he had just been elected. The next year
gave a favourable turn to his fortunes. The accession of George I.
brought back the Whigs, and S. was appointed to various offices, including
a commissionership on forfeited estates in Scotland, which
took him to Edinburgh, where he was welcomed by all the <i>literati</i>
there. Nothing, however, could keep him out of financial embarrassments,
and other troubles followed: his wife <i>d.</i>; differences,
arose with Addison, who <i>d.</i> before a reconciliation could be effected.<a name='Page_358'></a>
The remaining years were clouded by financial troubles and ill-health.
His last work was a play, <i>The Conscious Lovers</i> (1722). He
left London and lived at Hereford and at Carmarthen, where he <i>d.</i>
after a partial loss of his faculties from paralysis.</p>

quarto ed. of Shakespeare, and assisted Dr. Johnson in his ed., and
also in his <i>Lives of the Poets</i>. In 1793 he himself brought out a new
ed. of Shakespeare, in which he dealt somewhat freely with the text.
He was in constant controversy with Ritson and other literary
antiquaries, and was also an acute detector of literary forgeries, including
those of Chatterton and Ireland.</p><br />

London School and Oxf., took to journalism, in which he distinguished
himself by his clearness of vision and vivid style. Connected
successively with the <i>National Observer</i>, the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
and the <i>Daily Mail</i>, he utilised the articles which appeared in these
and other publications in various books, such as <i>The Land of the
Dollar</i> (America) (1897), <i>With Kitchener to Kartoum</i>, and <i>The
Tragedy of Dreyfus</i>. His most striking work, however, was <i>Monologues
of the Dead</i> (1895). He went as war correspondent to South

<a name='STEPHEN_SIR_JAMES_1789_1859'></a><p><b>STEPHEN, SIR JAMES (1789-1859).</b>
&mdash;Statesman and historical
writer, <i>s.</i> of James S., Master in Chancery, <i>ed.</i> at Camb., and
called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn 1811. After practising with
success, accepted appointment of permanent counsel to Colonial
Office and Board of Trade 1825, and was subsequently, 1826-47,
permanent Under-Sec. for the Colonies, in which capacity he exercised
an immense influence on the colonial policy of the empire, and
did much to bring about the abolition of the slave trade. Impaired
health led to his resignation, when he was made K.C.B. and a
Privy Councillor. He was afterwards Prof. of Modern History at
Camb. 1849-59, and of the same subject at the East India Coll. at
Haileybury 1855-57. He wrote <i>Essays in Ecclesiastical Biography</i>
(1849) and <i>Lectures on the History of France</i> (1852).</p><br />

<a name='STEPHEN_SIR_LESLIE_1832_1904'></a><p><b>STEPHEN, SIR LESLIE (1832-1904).</b>
&mdash;Biographer and
critic, <i>s.</i> of the above, was <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i> at Eton,
King's Coll., London, and Camb., where he obtained a tutorial
Fellowship, and took orders. He came under the influence of Mill,
Darwin, and H. Spencer, and devoted himself largely to the study
of economics. His religious views having undergone a change, he
gave up the clerical character and his Fellowship, and became a pronounced
Agnostic. In 1865 he definitely adopted a literary career,
and contributed to the <i>Saturday Review</i>, <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, and
other periodicals. In 1873 he <i>pub.</i> a collection of his essays as <i>Free
Thinking and Plain Speaking</i>, which he followed up with <i>An<a name='Page_359'></a>
Agnostic's Apology</i> (1893). He became ed. in 1871 of the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i>, in which appeared the essays afterwards <i>coll.</i> as <i>Hours in
a Library</i> (3 series, 1874-79). His chief work was <i>The History of
English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</i> (1876-81). He also wrote
<i>Science of Ethics</i> (1882), and biographies of <i>Dr. Johnson</i> (1878), <i>Pope</i>
(1880). <i>Swift</i> (1882), and <i>George Eliot</i> (English Men of Letters
Series). In 1882 he became ed. of the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>, to which he devoted much labour, besides contributing
many of the principal articles. <i>The English Utilitarians</i> appeared
in 1900. As a biographical and critical writer he holds a very high
place. His first wife was a <i>dau.</i> of Thackeray. In recognition of
his literary eminence he was made a K.C.B.</p>

<a name='STEPHENS_THOMAS_1821_1875'></a><p><b>STEPHENS, THOMAS (1821-1875).</b>
&mdash;Welsh historian and
critic, <i>b.</i> at Pont Nedd Fechan, Glamorganshire, <i>s.</i> of a shoemaker.
His works include <i>The Literature of the Kymry</i> (1849), <i>The History
of Trial by Jury in Wales</i>, and an essay in which he demolished the
claim of the Welsh under Madoc to the discovery of America. He
also wrote on the life and works of the bard Aneurin. The critical
methods which he adopted in his works often made him unpopular
with the less discriminating enthusiasts for the glory of Wales, but
he earned the respect of serious scholars.</p><br />

<a name='STERLING_JOHN_1806_1844'></a><p><b>STERLING, JOHN (1806-1844).</b>
&mdash;Essayist and miscellaneous
writer, <i>s.</i> of Edward S., a well-known writer in the <i>Times</i>,
was <i>b.</i> in Bute, and <i>ed.</i> at Glasgow and Camb. At the latter he
became acquainted with a group of brilliant men, including F.D.
Maurice, Trench, and Monckton Milnes. He took orders and became
curate to <a href='#HARE_JULIUS_CHARLES_1795_1855'>Julius Hare</a> (<i>q.v.</i>); but intellectual difficulties and
indifferent health led to his resignation within a year, and the rest
of his life was passed in alternating between England and warmer
climes. He wrote for <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, the <i>London and Westminster</i>,
and <i>Quarterly Reviews</i>, and <i>pub.</i> <i>Essays and Tales</i>, <i>The Election</i>,
a humorous poem, <i>Strafford</i>, a tragedy, and <i>Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion</i>, a serio-comic poem of which three books out of eight were <i>pub.</i>
His memory, perpetuated in a remarkable memoir by Carlyle, lives
rather by what he was than by anything he did. His character and
intellect appear to have exercised a singular influence on the eminent
men he numbered among his friends.</p><br />

<a name='STERNE_LAURENCE_1713_1768'></a><p><b>STERNE, LAURENCE (1713-1768).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>s.</i> of an
officer in the army, and the great-grandson of an Archbishop of
York, was <i>b.</i> at Clonmel, where his father's regiment happened to
be stationed, and passed part of his boyhood in Ireland. At the age
of 10 he was handed over to a relation, Mr. Sterne of Elvington in
Yorkshire, who put him to school at Halifax, and thereafter sent
him to Camb. He entered the Church, a profession for which he was
very indifferently fitted, and through family influence procured the
living of Sutton, Yorkshire. In 1741 he <i>m.</i> a lady&mdash;Miss Lumley&mdash;whose
influence obtained for him in addition an adjacent benefice,
and he also became a prebendary of York. It was not until 1760
that the first two vols. of his famous novel, <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, appeared.
Its peculiar and original style of humour, its whimsicality,
<a name='Page_360'></a>and perhaps also its defiance of conventionality, and even its frequent
lapses into indecorum, achieved for it an immediate and
immense popularity. S. went up to London and became the lion of
the day. The third and fourth vols. appeared in 1761, the fifth and
sixth in 1762, the seventh and eighth in 1765, and the last in 1767.
Meanwhile he had <i>pub.</i> the <i>Sermons of Mr. Yorick</i> (1760), and his
remaining work, <i>The Sentimental Journey</i> appeared in 1768. From
the time of his finding himself a celebrity his parishioners saw but
little of him, his time being passed either in the gaieties of London
or in travelling on the Continent. Latterly he was practically
separated from his wife and only <i>dau.</i>, to the former of whom his
behaviour had been anything but exemplary. His health, which
had begun to give way soon after his literary career had commenced,
finally broke down, and he fell into a consumption, of which he <i>d.</i> in
London on March 18, 1768, utterly alone and unattended. His
body was followed to the grave by one coach containing his publisher
and another gentleman; and it was exhumed and appeared in a few
days upon the table of the anatomical professor at Camb. He <i>d.</i> in
debt, but a subscription was raised for his wife and <i>dau.</i>, the latter of
whom <i>m.</i> a Frenchman, and is said to have perished under the guillotine.
Worthless as a man, S. possessed undoubted genius. He
had wit, originality, and pathos, though the last not seldom runs into
mawkishness, and an exquisitely delicate and glancing style. He
has contributed some immortal characters to English fiction, including
Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim. His great faults as a
writer are affectation and a peculiarly deliberate kind of indecency,
which his profession renders all the more offensive; and he was by
no means scrupulous in adopting, without acknowledgment, the good
things of previous writers.</p>

&mdash;Novelist and
essayist, was <i>b.</i> at Edin., the <i>s.</i> of Thomas S., a distinguished civil
engineer. His health was extremely delicate. He was destined for
the engineering profession, in which his family had for two generations
been eminent, but having neither inclination nor physical
strength for it, he in 1871 exchanged it for law, and was called to the
Bar in 1875, but never practised. From childhood his interests had
been literary, and in 1871 he began to contribute to the <i>Edinburgh
University Magazine</i> and the <i>Portfolio</i>. A tour in a canoe in 1876
led to the publication in 1878 of his first book, <i>An Inland Voyage</i>. In
the same year, <i>The New Arabian Nights</i>, afterwards separately <i>pub.</i>
appeared in magazines, and in 1879 he brought out <i>Travels with
a Donkey in the Cevennes</i>. In that year he went to California
and <i>m.</i> Mrs. Osbourne. Returning to Europe in 1880 he entered
<a name='Page_361'></a>upon a period of productiveness which, in view of his wretched
health, was, both as regards quantity and worth, highly remarkable.
The year 1881 was marked by his unsuccessful candidature for the
Chair of Constitutional Law and History at Edin., and by the publication
of <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i>. Other works followed in rapid succession.
<i>Treasure Island</i> (1882), <i>Prince Otto</i> and <i>The Child's Garden
of Verse</i> (1885), <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> and <i>Kidnapped</i> (1886),
<i>Underwoods</i> (poetry), <i>Memories and Portraits</i> (essays), and <i>The
Merry Men</i>, a collection of short stories (1887), and in 1888 <i>The
Black Arrow</i>. In 1887 he went to America, and in the following year
visited the South Sea Islands where, in Samoa, he settled in 1890,
and where he <i>d.</i> and is buried. In 1889 <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>
appeared, in 1892 <i>Across the Plains</i> and <i>The Wrecker</i>, in 1893 <i>Island
Nights Entertainments</i> and <i>Catriona</i>, and in 1894 <i>The Ebb Tide</i> in
collaboration with his step-son, Mr. Lloyd Osbourne. By this time
his health was completely broken, but to the last he continued the
struggle, and left the fragments <i>St. Ives</i> and <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>, the
latter containing some of his best work. They were <i>pub.</i> in 1897.
Though the originality and power of S.'s writings was recognised
from the first by a select few, it was only slowly that he caught the
ear of the general public. The tide may be said to have turned with
the publication of <i>Treasure Island</i> in 1882, which at once gave him
an assured place among the foremost imaginative writers of the day.
His greatest power is, however, shown in those works which deal
with Scotland in the 18th century, such as <i>Kidnapped</i>, <i>Catriona</i>, and
<i>Weir of Hermiston</i>, and in those, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>The Child's Garden of Verse</i>,
which exhibit his extraordinary insight into the psychology of child-life;
<i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is a marvellously powerful and subtle
psychological story, and some of his short tales also are masterpieces.
Of these <i>Thrawn Janet</i> and <i>Will of the Mill</i> may be mentioned
as examples in widely different kinds. His excursions into
the drama in collaboration with W.E. Henley&mdash;<i>Deacon Brodie</i>,
<i>Macaire</i>, <i>Admiral Guinea</i>, <i>Beau Austin</i>,&mdash;added nothing to his
reputation. His style is singularly fascinating, graceful, various,
subtle, and with a charm all its own.</p>

receiving the appointment of regular assistant two years later. In
1785 he became Prof. of Moral Philosophy, and rendered the chair
illustrious by his learning and eloquence, his pupils including Lords
Palmerston, Russell, and Lansdowne. S. was, however, rather a
brilliant expositor than an original thinker, and in the main followed
<a href='#REID_THOMAS_1710_1796'>Reid</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). His works include <i>Philosophy of the Human Mind</i>, in
three vols., <i>pub.</i> respectively in 1792, 1813, and 1827, <i>Outlines of
Moral Philosophy</i> (1793), <i>Philosophical Essays</i> (1810), <i>Dissertation
on the Progress of Metaphysical and Ethical Philosophy</i> (1815, part II.
1821), and <i>View of the Active and Moral Powers of Man</i>. He also
wrote memoirs of Robertson the historian, Adam Smith, and Reid.
The Whig party, which he had always supported, on their accession
<a name='Page_362'></a>to power, created for him the office of Gazette-writer for Scotland,
in recognition of his services to philosophy. His later years were
passed in retirement at Kinneil House on the Forth. His works were

of St. Paul's (1678), and the Bishopric of Worcester (1689). He
was a frequent speaker in the House of Lords, and had considerable
influence as a Churchman. A keen controversialist, he wrote many
treatises, including <i>The Irenicum</i> (advocating compromise with the

devoted himself to philosophy. His <i>Secret of Hegel</i> (1865) gave a
great impulse to the study and understanding of the Hegelian philosophy
both at home and in America, and was also accepted as a work
of authority in Germany and Italy. Other works, all characterised:
by keen philosophical insight and masterly power of exposition are

&mdash;Historian and antiquary, <i>b.</i>
in London, <i>s.</i> of a tailor, and brought up to the same trade. He
had, however, an irresistible taste for transcribing and collecting
ancient documents, and pursuing antiquarian and historical researches,
to which he ultimately entirely devoted himself. This he
was enabled to do partly through the munificence of Archbishop
Parker. He made large collections of old books and manuscripts,
and wrote and ed. several works of importance and authority, including
<i>The Woorkes of Geoffrey Chaucer</i>, <i>Summarie of Englyshe
Chronicles</i> (1561), afterwards called <i>Annales of England</i>, ed. of the
chronicles of Matthew Paris and others, of Holinshed's <i>Chronicle</i>,
and <i>A Survey of London</i> (1598). It is sad to think that the only
reward of his sacrifices and labours in the public interest was a
patent from James I. to collect &quot;among our loving subjects their
voluntary contributions and kind gratuities.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='STOWE_MRS_HARRIET_BEECHER_1811_1896'></a><p><b>STOWE, MRS. HARRIET BEECHER (1811?-1896).</b>
&mdash;Novelist
and miscellaneous writer, <i>dau.</i> of Dr. Lyman Beecher, a well-known
American clergyman, and sister of Henry Ward B., one of the
most popular preachers whom America has produced, was <i>b.</i> at
Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1811 or 1812. After spending some years
as a teacher, she <i>m.</i> the Rev. Calvin E. Stowe. Up till 1852 all she
had written was a little vol. of stories which failed to attract attention.
In that year, at the suggestion of a sister-in-law, she decided
to write something against slavery, and produced <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i>, which originally appeared in serial form in a magazine, <i>The
National Era</i>. It did not at the time receive much attention, but on
its appearance in a separate form it took the world by storm. Its
sale soon reached 400,000 copies, and the reprints have probably
<a name='Page_364'></a>reached a far greater number. It was translated into numerous
foreign languages, and had a powerful effect in hurrying on the
events which ultimately resulted in emancipation. Her later
works include <i>Dred</i>, <i>The Minister's Wooing</i>, <i>Agnes of Sorrento</i>, <i>The
Pearl of Orr's Island</i>, and <i>Old Town Folks</i>. Some of these, especially
the last, are in a literary sense much superior to <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i>, but none of them had more than an ordinary success. In
1869 an article on Lord Byron involved her in a somewhat unfortunate
controversy.</p><br />

and began her literary career with a poem, <i>Worcester Field</i>, followed
by <i>The Seven Ages of Woman</i> and <i>Demetrius</i>. Abandoning poetry
she next produced among others <i>Historical Tales of Illustrious
British Children</i> (1833), <i>The Pilgrims of Walsingham</i> (1835), <i>Tales and
Stories from History</i> (1836). Her chief works, however, are <i>Lives
of the Queens of England from the Norman Conquest</i>, and <i>Lives of the
Queens of Scotland</i>, and <i>English Princesses, etc.</i> (8 vols., 1850-59),
<i>Lives of the Bachelor Kings of England</i> (1861), and <i>Letters of Mary
Queen of Scots</i>, in some of which she was assisted by her sister Elizabeth.
Though laborious and conscientious she lacked the judicial
faculty, and her style does not rise above mediocrity.</p><br />

<a name='STRODE_WILLIAM_1600_1645'></a><p><b>STRODE, WILLIAM (1600-1645).</b>
&mdash;Poet, only <i>s.</i> of Philip S.,
who belonged to an old Devonshire family, he was <i>b.</i> at Plympton,
Devonshire, and showing studious tendencies, was sent to Westminster
School and Oxf. While at the Univ. he began to manifest
his poetic talents, and generally distinguished himself, being elected
in 1629 Public Orator. He took orders and, on <a href='#CORBET_RICHARD_1582_1635'>Richard Corbet</a>
(<i>q.v.</i>) becoming Bishop of Oxf., became his chaplain. Later he was
Rector of E. Bredenham, Norfolk, and of Badley, Northants, and
Canon of Christ Church. On the outbreak of the Civil War he
attached himself warmly to the cause of the King. He was a High
Churchman, and had a reputation as &quot;a witty and sententious
preacher, an exquisite orator, and an eminent poet.&quot; It is therefore
singular that, until the recovery of his poems by Mr. B. Dobell, he
had fallen into absolute oblivion. As a poet he shines most in lyrics
and elegies. With much of the artificiality of his age he shows
gracefulness, a feeling for the country, and occasional gleams of
tenderness. His play, <i>The Floating Island</i>, a political allegory, was
produced in 1633 and played before the Court then on a visit to Oxf.,
where it was a subject of complaint that it had more moralising than
amusement. Mr. Dobell, who ed. his poems in 1907, claims for S.
the poem on &quot;Melancholy&quot; (&quot;Hence all you vain delights&quot;),
hitherto attributed to Fletcher.</p><br />

and, among other livings, held the Rectory of Low Leyton, Essex,
for upwards of 60 years. He made a large collection of original
documents, chiefly relating to the Tudor period, and was a voluminous
author. Among his works are <i>Memorials of Archbishop

and <i>Ecclesiastical Memorials</i> (1721); besides Lives of Bishop

were <i>An Historical Dissertation on the English Constitution</i>
(1768), <i>Discourse on the Government and Laws of England</i> (1772), <i>A
View of Society in Europe</i> (1778), and a <i>History of Scotland</i> (1782).
He was a man of extremely jealous and implacable temper, and
made venomous attacks on the historical works of Robertson and
Henry. His own writings, though well-written, are inaccurate.</p><br />

<a name='STUBBS_WILLIAM_1825_1901'></a><p><b>STUBBS, WILLIAM (1825-1901).</b>
&mdash;Historian, <i>s.</i> of a
solicitor, <i>b.</i> at Knaresborough, Yorkshire, and <i>ed.</i> there and at the
Grammar School of Ripon, and Oxf. In 1848 he became a Fellow
of Trinity Coll., and in the same year took orders and was appointed
to the coll. living of Navestock in Essex, where he remained for 16
years, during which he began his historical researches, and <i>pub.</i> his
earlier works. His first publication was <i>Hymnale Secundum Usum
Sarum</i>. In 1858 appeared <i>Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum</i>, a
calendar of English bishops from Augustine; and then followed ed.
of several Chronicles in the Rolls Series. The learning and critical
insight displayed in these works commanded the attention and admiration
of historical scholars both at home and on the Continent.
In 1862 he was appointed librarian of Lambeth Palace, and in 1866
Prof. of Modern History at Oxf. There he <i>pub.</i> in 1870 his <i>Select
Charters</i>, and his chief work, <i>The Constitutional History of England</i>
(3 vols., 1874-78), which at once became the standard authority on
its subject. It deals with the period preceding that with which the
great work of Hallam begins. In 1879 he was appointed a Canon of
St. Paul's, and in 1884 Bishop of Chester, whence he was translated
five years later to Oxf. As an active prelate he was necessarily
largely withdrawn from his historical researches; but at Chester he
ed. two vols. of William of Malmesbury. S. was greater as a historian
than as a writer, but he brought to his work sound judgment,
insight, accuracy, and impartiality. He was a member of the
French and Prussian Academies, and had the Prussian Order &quot;Pour
le M&eacute;rite&quot; conferred upon him. Since his death his prefaces to the
Rolls Series have been <i>pub.</i> separately.</p><br />

and thereafter went to Gray's Inn. On the death of his <i>f.</i> in 1627, he
<a name='Page_366'></a>inherited large estates. After travelling in France and Italy, he is
said to have served for a short time under Gustavus Adolphus. On
his return he was knighted, and went to Court, where his wealth,
generosity, and wit made him a general favourite. When Charles
I. was moving against the Scots S. fitted out a gorgeously appointed
troop for his service which, however, were said to have fled at first
sight of the Scots army at Duns, an exploit which is ridiculed in the
ballad of <i>Sir John Suckling's Campaign</i>. He got into trouble in
connection with a plot to rescue Strafford from the Tower, and fled
to the Continent. He <i>d.</i> at Paris, it is now believed by his own hand.
He was a noted gambler, and has the distinction of being the inventor
of the game of cribbage. He wrote four plays, <i>Aglaura</i>
(1637), <i>Brennoralt</i> (1646), <i>The Goblins</i>, and <i>The Sad One</i> (unfinished),
now forgotten; his fame rests on his songs and ballads,
including <i>The Wedding</i>, distinguished by a gay and sparkling wit,

to the Court, was cup-bearer to the King (Henry VIII.), ewerer
at the Coronation, and Earl Marshall at the trial of Anne Boleyn.
In 1542 he was made a Knight of the Garter a few weeks after the
execution of his cousin, Queen Catherine Howard. He suffered imprisonment
more than once for being implicated in quarrels and
brawls, did a good deal of fighting in Scotland and France, and was
the last victim of Henry's insensate jealousy, being beheaded on a
frivolous charge of conspiring against the succession of Edward VI.
The death of Henry saved Norfolk from the same fate. S. shares
with <a href='#WYATT_SIR_THOMAS_1503_1542'>Sir Thomas Wyatt</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) the honour of being the true successor
of Chaucer in English poetry, and he has the distinction of being, in
his translation of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, the first to introduce blank verse, and,
with Wyatt, the sonnet. The poems of S., though well known in
courtly circles, were not <i>pub.</i> during his life; 40 of them appeared in
<i>Tottel's Miscellany</i> in 1557. He also paraphrased part of Ecclesiastes
and a few of the Psalms. The Geraldine of his sonnets was Elizabeth
Fitzgerald, <i>dau.</i> of the Earl of Kildare, then a lonely child at Court,

<a name='SWIFT_JONATHAN_1667_1745'></a><p><b>SWIFT, JONATHAN (1667-1745).</b>
&mdash;Satirist, was <i>b.</i> at
Dublin of English parents. Dryden was his cousin, and he also
claimed kin with Herrick. He was a posthumous child, and was
brought up in circumstances of extreme poverty. He was sent to
school at Kilkenny, and afterwards went to Trinity Coll., Dublin,
where he gave no evidence of ability, but displayed a turbulent and
unruly temper, and only obtained a degree by &quot;special grace.&quot;
After the Revolution he joined his mother, then resident at Leicester,
<a name='Page_367'></a>by whose influence he was admitted to the household of <a href='#TEMPLE_SIR_WILLIAM_1628_1699'>Sir William
Temple</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) at Moor Park, Lady T. being her distant kinswoman.
Here he acted as sec., and having access to a well-stocked library,
made good use of his opportunities, and became a close student. At
Moor Park he met many distinguished men, including William III.,
who offered him a troop of horse; he also met Esther Johnson
(Stella), a natural <i>dau.</i> of Sir William, who was afterwards to enter
so largely into his life. Dissatisfied, apparently, that Temple did not
do more for his advancement, he left his service in 1694 and returned
to Ireland, where he took orders, and obtained the small living of Kilroot,
near Belfast. While there he wrote his <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, one of the
most consummate pieces of satire in any language, and <i>The Battle of
the Books</i>, with reference to the &quot;Phalaris&quot; controversy (<i>see</i> <a href='#BENTLEY_RICHARD_1662_1742'>Bentley</a>),
which were <i>pub.</i> together in 1704. In 1698 he threw up his living at
the request of Temple, who felt the want of his society and assistance,
and returned to Moor Park. On the death of his patron in 1699 he
undertook by request the publication of his works, and thereafter
returned to Ireland as chaplain to the Lord Deputy, the Earl of
Berkeley, from whom he obtained some small preferments, including
the vicarage of Laracor, and a prebend in St. Patrick's Cathedral.
At this time he made frequent visits to London and became the
friend of Addison, Steele, Congreve, and other Whig writers, and
wrote various pamphlets, chiefly on ecclesiastical subjects. In 1710,
disgusted with the neglect of the Whigs, alike of himself and of the
claims of his Church, he abandoned them and attached himself to
Harley and Bolingbroke. The next few years were filled with
political controversy. He attacked the Whigs in papers in the
<i>Examiner</i> in 1710, and in his celebrated pamphlets, <i>The Conduct of
the Allies</i> (1712), <i>The Barrier Treaty</i> (1713), and <i>The Public Spirit of
the Whigs</i> (1714). In 1713 he was made Dean of St. Patrick's, the
last piece of patronage which he received. The steady dislike of
Queen Anne had proved an insurmountable obstacle to his further
advancement, and her death proved the ruin of the Tories. On the
destruction of his hopes S. retired to Ireland, where he remained
for the rest of his life a thoroughly embittered man. In 1713 he
had begun his <i>Journal to Stella</i>, which sheds so strange a light upon
his character, and on his return to Ireland his marriage to her is
now generally believed to have taken place, though they never lived
together. Now also took place also his final rupture with Miss
Van Homrigh (Vanessa), who had been in love with him, with whom
he had maintained a lengthened correspondence, and to whom he
addressed his poem, <i>Cadenus and Vanessa</i> (1726). Though he disliked
the Irish and considered residence in Ireland as banishment, he
interested himself in Irish affairs, and attained extraordinary popularity
by his <i>Drapier's Letters</i>, directed against the introduction of
&quot;Wood's halfpence.&quot; In 1726 he visited England and joined with
Pope and Arbuthnot in publishing <i>Miscellanies</i> (1727). In the same
year, 1726, he <i>pub.</i> <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, his most widely and permanently
popular work. His last visit to England was paid in 1727 and
in the following year &quot;Stella,&quot; the only being, probably, whom he
really loved, <i>d.</i> Though he had a circle of friends in Dublin, and
was, owing to his championing the people in their grievances, a
popular idol, the shadows were darkening around him. The fears of
<a name='Page_368'></a>insanity by which he had been all his life haunted, and which may
account for and perhaps partly excuse some of the least justifiable
portions of his conduct, pressed more and more upon him. He became
increasingly morose and savage in his misanthropy, and
though he had a rally in which he produced some of his most brilliant,
work&mdash;the <i>Rhapsody on Poetry</i>, <i>Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift</i>, and;
the <i>Modest Proposal</i> (a horrible but masterly piece of irony)&mdash;he gradually
sank into almost total loss of his facilities, and <i>d.</i> on
October 19, 1745.</p>

<p>The character of S. is one of the gloomiest and least attractive among
English writers. Intensely proud, he suffered bitterly in
youth and early manhood from the humiliations of poverty and dependence,
which preyed upon a mind in which the seeds of insanity
were latent until it became dominated by a ferocious misanthropy.
As a writer he is our greatest master of grave irony, and while he
presents the most humorous ideas, the severity of his own countenance
never relaxes. The <i>Tale of a Tub</i> and <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> are the
greatest satires in the English language, although the concluding
part of the latter is a savage and almost insane attack upon
the whole human race. His history is a tragedy darkening into
catastrophe, and as Thackeray has said, &quot;So great a man he seems that
thinking of him is like thinking of an Empire falling.&quot;</p>

<p>S. was tall and powerfully made. His eyes, blue and flashing
under excitement, were the most remarkable part of his appearance.</p>

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i>
of Admiral S. and of Lady Jane Ashburnham, <i>dau.</i> of the 3rd Earl
of A., <i>b.</i> in London, received his early education in France, and
was at Eton and at Balliol Coll., Oxf., where he attracted the attention
of Jowett, and gave himself to the study of Latin, Greek,
French, and Italian, with special reference to poetic form. He left
Oxf. without graduating in 1860, and in the next year <i>pub.</i> two
plays, <i>The Queen Mother</i> and <i>Rosamund</i>, which made no impression
on the public, though a few good judges recognised their
promise. The same year he visited Italy, and there made the acquaintance
of <a href='#LANDOR_WALTER_SAVAGE_1775_1864'>Walter Savage Landor</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). On his return he lived
<a name='Page_369'></a>for some time in Cheyne Row, Chelsea, with <a href='#ROSSETTI_DANTE_GABRIEL_1828_1882'>D.G. Rossetti</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and
<a href='#MEREDITH_GEORGE_1828_1909'>G. Meredith</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). The appearance in 1865 of <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>
led to his immediate recognition as a poet of the first order, and
in the same year he <i>pub.</i> <i>Chastelard, a Tragedy</i>, the first part of a
trilogy relating to Mary Queen of Scots, the other two being <i>Bothwell</i>
(1874), and <i>Mary Stuart</i> (1881). <i>Poems and Ballads</i>, <i>pub.</i> in
1866, created a profound sensation alike among the critics and the
general body of readers by its daring departure from recognised standards,
alike of politics and morality, and gave rise to a prolonged and
bitter controversy, S. defending himself against his assailants in
<i>Notes on Poems and Reviews</i>. His next works were the <i>Song of Italy</i>
(1867) and <i>Songs before Sunrise</i> (1871). Returning to the Greek
models which he had followed with such brilliant success in <i>Atalanta</i>
he produced <i>Erechtheus</i> (1876), the extraordinary metrical power of
which won general admiration. <i>Poems and Ballads</i>, second series,
came out in 1878. <i>Tristram of Lyonnesse</i> in heroic couplets followed
in 1882, <i>A Midsummer Holiday</i> (1884), <i>Marino Faliero</i> (1885),
<i>Locrine</i> (1887), <i>Poems and Ballads</i>, third series (1889), <i>The Sisters</i>
(1892), <i>Astrophel</i> (1894), <i>The Tale of Balen</i> (1896), <i>Rosamund, Queen
of the Lombards</i> (1899), <i>A Channel Passage</i> (1904), and <i>The Duke of
Gandia</i> (1908). Among his prose works are <i>Love's Cross Currents</i>
(1905) (fiction), <i>William Blake, a Critical Essay</i> (1867), <i>Under the
Microscope</i> (1872), in answer to R. Buchanan's <i>Fleshly School of
Poetry</i>, <i>George Chapman, a Critical Essay</i> (1875), <i>A Study of Shakespeare</i>
(1879), <i>A Study of Victor Hugo</i> (1886), and <i>A Study of Ben Jonson</i>
(1889).</p>

<p>S. belongs to the class of &quot;Poets' poets.&quot; He never became
widely popular. As a master of metre he is hardly excelled by any
of our poets, but it has not seldom been questioned whether his marvellous
sense of the beauty of words and their arrangement did not
exceed the depth and mass of his thought. <i>The Hymn to Artemis</i> in
<i>Atalanta</i> beginning &quot;When the hounds of Spring are on Winter's
traces&quot; is certainly one of the most splendid examples of metrical
power in the language. As a prose writer he occupies a much lower
place, and here the contrast between the thought and its expression
becomes very marked, the latter often becoming turgid and even
violent. In his earlier days in London S. was closely associated with
the pre-Raphaelites, the Rossettis, Meredith, and Burne-Jones: he
was thus subjected successively to the classical and romantic influence,
and showed the traces of both in his work. He was never
<i>m.</i>, and for the last 30 years of his life lived with his friend, Mr. Theodore
Watts-Dunton, at the Pines, Putney Hill. For some time
before his death he was almost totally deaf.</p><br />

songs, which met with success, and carried his hitherto local fame
over his native country. Always delicate and sensitive, a disappointment
in regard to the publication of an enlarged ed. of his poems so
wrought upon a lowness of spirits, to which he was subject, that he
drowned himself in a canal. His longer pieces are now forgotten,
but some of his songs have achieved a popularity only second to that

Dr. Johnson, kept the stage till well on in the 19th century. He
also wrote various miscellaneous poems, now happily forgotten.

&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in Pennsylvania
of Quaker descent, began to write by the time he was 12. Apprenticed
to a printer, he found the work uncongenial and, purchasing
his indentures, went to Europe on a walking tour, and thereafter he
was a constant and enterprising traveller. After his return from
Europe he ed. a paper, got on the staff of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, and
<i>pub.</i> several books of travel and poetry, among which are <i>Views Afoot</i>
(1846), an account of his travels in Europe, and <i>El Dorado</i> (1850),
which described the Californian gold-fields. After some experience
and some disappointments in the diplomatic sphere, he settled down
to novel-writing, his first venture in which, <i>Hannah Thurston</i> (1863),
was very successful, and was followed by <i>John Godfrey's Fortunes</i>
(1864), partly autobiographical, and <i>The Story of Kenneth</i> (1866).
His poetic works include <i>Poems of the Orient</i> (1854), <i>Poet's Journal</i>
(1862), <i>Masque of the Gods</i> (1872), <i>Lars</i> (1873), <i>The Prophet</i> (1874),
a tragedy, <i>Prince Deucalion</i>, and <i>Home Pastorals</i> (1875). In 1878
he was appointed to the German Embassy, and <i>d.</i> in Berlin in the
following year. His translation of Goethe's <i>Faust</i> is perhaps his
best work. He was a man of untiring energy and great ability and
versatility, but tried too many avenues to fame to advance very far

some months and in the Naval Stores Department, he became a
clerk in the Colonial Office, and remained there for 48 years, during
which he exercised considerable influence on the colonial policy of
the Empire. In 1872 he was made K.C.M.G. He wrote four
tragedies&mdash;<i>Isaac Comnenus</i> (1827), <i>Philip van Artevelde</i> (1834),

comedy, <i>The Virgin Widow</i>, which he renamed <i>A Sicilian Summer</i>,
<i>The Eve of the Conquest and other Poems</i> (1847). In prose he <i>pub.
The Statesman</i> (1836), <i>Notes from Life</i> (1847), <i>Notes from Books</i>
(1849), and an <i>Autobiography</i>. Of all these <i>Philip van Artevelde</i> was

<a name='TAYLOR_ISAAC_1787_1865'></a><p><b>TAYLOR, ISAAC (1787-1865).</b>
&mdash;Philosophical and historical
writer, artist, and inventor, was the most eminent member of a
family known as the Taylors of Ongar, which has shown a remarkable
persistence of ability in various departments, but especially in
art and literature. His grandfather and <i>f.</i>, who bore the same
name, were both eminent engravers, and the latter was the author
of various books for children. T. was brought up to the hereditary
art of engraving, in which he displayed pre-eminent skill, his work
gaining the admiration of D.G. Rossetti. He decided, however, to
devote himself to literature, and for 40 years continued to produce
works of originality and value, including <i>Elements of Thought</i> (1823),
<i>Natural History of Enthusiasm</i> (1829), <i>Spiritual Despotism</i> (1831),
<i>Ancient Christianity</i> (1839), <i>Restoration of Belief</i> (1855), <i>The Physical
Theory of Another Life</i>, <i>History of Transmission of Ancient Books</i>, and
<i>Home Education</i>, besides numerous contributions to reviews and
other periodicals. Besides his literary and artistic accomplishments
T. was an important inventor, two of his inventions having done
much to develop the manufacture of calico. Two of his sisters had
considerable literary reputation. ANN T., afterwards MRS. GILBERT
(1782-1866), and JANE (1783-1824) were, like their brother, taught
the art of engraving. In 1804-5 they jointly wrote <i>Original Poems
for Infant Minds</i>, followed by <i>Rhymes for the Nursery</i> and <i>Hymns for
Infant Minds</i>. Among those are the little poems, &quot;My Mother&quot;
and &quot;Twinkle, twinkle, little Star,&quot; known to all well-conditioned
children. Jane was also the author of <i>Display</i>, a tale (1815), and
other works, including several hymns, of which the best known is
&quot;Lord, I would own Thy tender Care.&quot; The hereditary talents of
the family were represented in the next generation by CANON ISAAC
T. (1829-1901), the <i>s.</i> of Isaac last mentioned, who, in addition to
<i>The Liturgy and the Dissenters</i>, <i>pub.</i> works in philology and arch&aelig;ology,
including <i>Words and Places</i> and <i>Etruscan Researches</i>; and by
JOSIAH GILBERT, <i>s.</i> of Ann T., an accomplished artist, and author
of <i>The Dolomite Mountains</i>, <i>Cadore, or Titian's Country</i>, and ed. of
the <i>Autobiography</i> of his mother.</p><br />

<a name='TAYLOR_JEREMY_1613_1667'></a><p><b>TAYLOR, JEREMY (1613-1667).</b>
&mdash;Divine, was <i>b.</i> at Camb.
His <i>f.</i>, though of gentle descent, followed the trade of a barber, and<a name='Page_373'></a>
Jeremy entered Caius Coll. as a sizar. After his graduation in 1634
he was asked to preach in London, where his eloquence attracted
the attention of Laud, who sent him to Oxf., caused him to be
elected a Fellow of All Souls Coll., and made him his chaplain. He
also became a chaplain to the King, and soon attaining a great reputation
as a preacher, was presented to the living of Uppingham. In
1639 he <i>m.</i> his first wife, and in 1643 he was made Rector of Overstone.
On the outbreak of the Civil War T. sided with the King,
and was present, probably as a chaplain, at the battle fought in 1645
near Cardigan Castle, when he was taken prisoner. He was soon
released, but the Royalist cause being practically lost, he decided to
remain in Wales, and with two friends started a school at Newtonhall,
Caermarthenshire, which had some success. T. also found a
friend in Lord Carbery, whose chaplain he became. During the
period of 13 years from 1647-60, which were passed in seeming
obscurity, he laid the foundations and raised the structure of his
splendid literary fame. The <i>Liberty of Prophesying</i> (that is, of
preaching), one of the greatest pleas for toleration in the language,
was <i>pub.</i> in 1647, <i>The Life of Christ</i> in 1649, <i>Holy Living</i> in 1650, and
<i>Holy Dying</i> in 1651. These were followed by various series of
sermons, and by <i>The Golden Grove</i> (1655), a manual of devotion
which received its title from the name of the seat of his friend Lord
Carbery. For some remarks against the existing authorities T.
suffered a short imprisonment, and some controversial tracts on
<i>Original Sin</i>, <i>Unum Necessarium</i> (the one thing needful), and
<i>The Doctrine and Practice of Repentance</i> involved him in a controversy
of some warmth in which he was attacked by both High
Churchmen and Calvinists. While in Wales T. had entered into a
second marriage with a lady of some property which, however, was
seriously encroached upon by the exactions of the Parliamentarians.
In 1657 he ministered privately to an Episcopalian congregation in
London, and in 1658 accompanied Lord Conway to Ireland, and
served a cure at Lisburn. Two years later he <i>pub.</i> <i>Ductor Dubitantium,
or the Rule of Conscience in all her General Measures</i>, a learned
and subtle piece of casuistry which he dedicated to Charles II. The
Restoration brought recognition of T.'s unswerving devotion to the
Royalist cause; he was made Bishop of Down and Connor, and to
this was added the administration of the see of Dromore. In his
new position, though, as might have been expected, he showed zeal,
diligence, and benevolence, he was not happy. He did not, probably
could not, entirely practise his own views of absolute toleration,
and found himself in conflict with the Presbyterians, some of whose
ministers he had extruded from benefices which they had held, and
he longed to escape to a more private and peaceful position. He <i>d.</i>
at Lisburn of a fever caught while ministering to a parishioner. T.
is one of the great classical writers of England. Learned, original,
and impassioned, he had an enthusiasm for religion and charity, and
his writings glow with an almost unequalled wealth of illustration
and imagery, subtle argument, and fullness of thought. With a
character of stainless purity and benevolence, and gracious and
gentle manners, he was universally beloved by all who came under
the spell of his presence<a name='Page_374'></a>.</p><br />

from London as far as to Braemar, of which he wrote an account, <i>The
Pennyless Pilgrimage ... of John Taylor</i>, <i>the King's Majesty's
Water Poet</i> (1618). He visited the Queen of Bohemia at Prague in

<a name='TENNYSON_ALFRED_1ST_LORD_1809_1892'></a><p><b>TENNYSON, ALFRED, 1ST LORD (1809-1892).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was
the fourth <i>s.</i> of George T., Rector of Somersby, Lincolnshire, where
he was <i>b.</i> His <i>f.</i> was himself a poet of some skill, and his two elder
brothers, <a href='#TENNYSON_FREDERICK_1807_1898'>Frederick T.</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) and <a href='#TENNYSON_TURNER_CHARLES_1808_1879'>Charles T. Turner</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), were poets
of a high order. His early education was received from his <i>f.</i>, after
which he went to the Grammar School of Louth, whence in 1828 he
proceeded to Trinity Coll., Camb. In the previous year had appeared
a small vol., <i>Poems by Two Brothers</i>, chiefly the work of his
brother Charles and himself, with a few contributions from Frederick,
but it attracted little attention. At the Univ. he was one of a group
of highly gifted men, including <a href='#TRENCH_RICHARD_CHENEVIX_1807_1886'>Trench</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), Monckton Milnes, afterwards
<a href='#HOUGHTON_RICHARD_MONCKTON_MILNES_1ST_LORD_1809_1885'>Lord Houghton</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), <a href='#ALFORD_HENRY_1810_1871'>Alford</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), Lushington, his future
brother-in-law, and above all, Arthur Hallam, whose friendship and
early death were to be the inspiration of his greatest poem. In 1829
he won the Chancellor's medal by a poem on <i>Timbuctoo</i>, and in the
following year he brought out his first independent work, <i>Poems
chiefly Lyrical</i>. It was not in general very favourably received by
the critics, though Wilson in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> admitted much
promise and even performance. In America it had greater popularity.
Part of 1832 was spent in travel with Hallam, and the same
year saw the publication of <i>Poems</i>, which had not much greater
success than its predecessor. In the next year Hallam <i>d.</i>, and T.
began <i>In Memoriam</i> and wrote <i>The Two Voices</i>. He also became
<a name='Page_376'></a>engaged to Emily Sellwood, his future wife, but owing to various circumstances
their marriage did not take place until 1850. The next
few years were passed with his family at various places, and, so far as
the public were concerned, he remained silent until 1842, when he <i>pub.</i>
<i>Poems</i> in two volumes, and at last achieved full recognition as a great
poet. From this time the life of T. is a record of tranquil triumph in his
art and of the conquest of fame; and the publication of his successive
works became almost the only events which mark his history. <i>The
Princess</i> appearing in 1847 added materially to his reputation: in
the lyrics with which it is interspersed, such as &quot;The Splendour
Falls&quot; and &quot;Tears, idle Tears&quot; he rises to the full mastery of this
branch of his art. The year 1850 was perhaps the most eventful
in his life, for in it took place his marriage which, as he said, &quot;brought
the peace of God into his life,&quot; his succession to the Laureateship on
the death of Wordsworth, and the publication of his greatest poem,
<i>In Memoriam</i>. In 1852 appeared his noble <i>Ode on the Death of the
Duke of Wellington</i>; and two years later <i>The Charge of the Light
Brigade</i>. The publication of <i>Maud</i> in 1855 gave his rapidly growing
popularity a perceptible set-back, though it has since risen in
favour. But this was far more than made up for by the enthusiasm
with which the first set of <i>The Idylls of the King</i> was received on its
appearance four years later. <i>Enoch Arden</i>, with the <i>Northern
Farmer</i>, came out in 1864; <i>The Holy Grail</i> and <i>Gareth and Lynette</i>,
both belonging to the <i>Idyll</i> series, in 1869 and 1872 respectively.
Three years later in 1875 T. broke new ground by beginning a series
of dramas with <i>Queen Mary</i>, followed by <i>Harold</i> (1876), <i>The Falcon</i>
(1879), <i>The Cup</i> (1881), <i>The Promise of May</i> (1882), <i>Becket</i> (1884),
and <i>Robin Hood</i> (1891). His later poems were <i>The Lovers' Tale</i>
(1879) (an early work retouched), <i>Tiresias</i> (1885), <i>Locksley Hall&mdash;60
Years after</i> (1886), <i>Demeter and other Poems</i> (1889), including &quot;Crossing
the Bar,&quot; and <i>The Death of &OElig;none</i> (1892). T., who cared little
for general society, though he had many intimate and devoted
friends, lived at Farringford, Isle of Wight, from 1853-69, when he
built a house at Aldworth, near Haslemere, which was his home
until his death. In 1884 he was raised to the peerage. Until he had
passed the threescore years and ten he had, with occasional illnesses,
enjoyed good health on the whole. But in 1886 the younger
of his two sons <i>d.</i>, a blow which told heavily upon him; thereafter
frequent attacks of illness followed, and he <i>d.</i> on October 6, 1892, in
his 84th year, and received a public funeral in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The poetry of T. is characterised by a wide outlook, by intense
sympathy with the deepest feelings and aspirations of humanity, a
profound realisation of the problems of life and thought, a noble
patriotism finding utterance in such poems as <i>The Revenge</i>, the
<i>Charge of the Light Brigade</i>, and the <i>Ode on the Death of the Duke of
Wellington</i>, an exquisite sense of beauty, marvellous power of vivid
and minute description often achieved by a single felicitous phrase,
and often heightened by the perfect matching of sense and sound,
and a general loftiness and purity of tone. No poet has excelled
him in precision and delicacy of language and completeness of
expression. As a lyrist he has, perhaps, no superiors, and only two
or three equals in English poetry, and even of humour he possessed
no small share, as is shown in the <i>Northern Farmer</i> and in other
<a name='Page_377'></a>pieces. When the volume, variety, finish, and duration of his work
are considered, as well as the influence which he exercised on his
time, a unique place must be assigned him among the poets of his country.</p>

<a name='THACKERAY_WILLIAM_MAKEPEACE_1811_1863'></a><p><b>THACKERAY, WILLIAM MAKEPEACE (1811-1863).</b>
&mdash;Novelist,
<i>s.</i> of Richmond T., who held various important appointments
in the service of the East India Company, and who belonged
to an old and respectable Yorkshire family, was <i>b.</i> at Calcutta, and
soon after the death of his <i>f.</i>, which took place in 1816, sent home
to England. After being at a school at Chiswick, he was sent to
the Charterhouse School, where he remained from 1822-26, and
where he does not appear to have been very happy. Meanwhile in
1818 his mother had <i>m.</i> Major H.W.C. Smythe, who is believed to be,
in part at any rate, the original of Colonel Newcome. In 1829
he went to Trinity Coll., Camb., where he remained for a year only,
and where he did not distinguish himself particularly as a student,
but made many life-long friends, including <a href='#SPEDDING_JAMES_1808_1881'>Spedding</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), <a href='#TENNYSON_ALFRED_1ST_LORD_1809_1892'>Tennyson</a>,
<a href='#FITZGERALD_EDWARD_1809_1883'>Fitzgerald</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and Monckton Milnes (<i>see</i> <a href='#HOUGHTON_RICHARD_MONCKTON_MILNES_1ST_LORD_1809_1885'>Houghton</a>), and contributed
verses and caricatures to two Univ. papers, &quot;The Snob&quot;
and &quot;The Gownsman.&quot; The following year, 1831, was spent
chiefly in travelling on the Continent, especially Germany, when, at
Weimar, he visited Goethe. Returning he entered the Middle
Temple, but having no liking for legal studies, he soon abandoned
them, and turning his attention to journalism, became proprietor,
wholly or in part, of two papers successively, both of which failed.
These enterprises, together with some unfortunate investments and
also,
it would seem, play, stripped him of the comfortable fortune, which
he had inherited; and he now found himself dependent on
his own exertions for a living. He thought at first of art as a
<a name='Page_378'></a>profession, and studied for a time at Paris and Rome. In 1836, while
acting as Paris correspondent for the second of his journals, he <i>m.</i>
Isabella, <i>dau.</i> of Colonel Shawe, an Irish officer, and the next year he
returned to England and became a contributor to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>,
in which appeared <i>The Yellowplush Papers</i>, <i>The Great Hoggarty
Diamond</i>, <i>Catherine</i>, and <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, the history of an Irish
sharper, which contains some of his best work. Other works of this
period were <i>The Paris Sketch-book</i> (1840) and <i>The Irish Sketch-book</i>
(1843). His work in <i>Fraser</i>, while it was appreciated at its true
worth by a select circle, had not brought him any very wide recognition:
it was his contributions to <i>Punch</i>&mdash;the <i>Book of Snobs</i> and
<i>Jeames's Diary</i>&mdash;which first caught the ear of the wider public.
The turning point in his career, however, was the publication in
monthly numbers of <i>Vanity Fair</i> (1847-48). This extraordinary
work gave him at once a place beside Fielding at the head of English
novelists, and left him no living competitor except Dickens. <i>Pendennis</i>,
largely autobiographical, followed in 1848-50, and fully
maintained his reputation. In 1851 he broke new ground, and appeared,
with great success, as a lecturer, taking for his subject <i>The
English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century</i>, following this up in
1855 with the <i>Four Georges</i>, first delivered in America. Meanwhile
<i>Esmond</i>, perhaps his masterpiece, and probably the greatest novel of
its kind in existence, had appeared in 1852, and <i>The Newcomes</i> (1853),
<i>The Virginians</i>, a sequel to <i>Esmond</i>, which, though containing much
fine work, is generally considered to show a falling off as compared
with its two immediate predecessors, came out in 1857-59. In 1860
the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> was started with T. for its ed., and to it he
contributed <i>Lovell the Widower</i> (1860), <i>The Adventures of Philip</i>
(1861-62), <i>The Roundabout Papers</i>, a series of charming essays, and
<i>Denis Duval</i>, left a mere fragment by his sudden death, but which
gave promise of a return to his highest level of performance. In
addition to the works mentioned, T. for some years produced
Christmas books and burlesques, of which the best were <i>The Rose
and the Ring</i> and <i>The Kickleburys on the Rhine</i>. He also wrote
graceful verses, some of which, like <i>Bouillabaisse</i>, are in a strain of
humour shot through with pathos, while others are the purest rollicking
fun. For some years T. suffered from spasms of the heart, and
he <i>d.</i> suddenly during the night of December 23, 1863, in his 53rd
year. He was a man of the tenderest heart, and had an intense
enjoyment of domestic happiness; and the interruption of this,
caused by the permanent breakdown of his wife's health, was a
heavy calamity. This, along with his own latterly broken health,
and a sensitiveness which made him keenly alive to criticism, doubtless
fostered the tendency to what was often superficially called his
cynical view of life. He possessed an inimitable irony and a power
of sarcasm which could scorch like lightning, but the latter is almost
invariably directed against what is base and hateful. To human
weakness he is lenient and often tender, and even when weakness
passes into wickedness, he is just and compassionate. He saw
human nature &quot;steadily and saw it whole,&quot; and paints it with a
light but sure hand. He was master of a style of great distinction
and individuality, and ranks as one of the very greatest of English
novelists.</p><a name='Page_379'></a>

same year <i>pub.</i> a translation of Schleiermacher's <i>Critical Essay on

orders in 1827, and the next year translated, with <a href='#HARE_JULIUS_CHARLES_1795_1855'>Julius Hare</a> (<i>q.v.</i>),
the first vol. of Niebuhr's <i>History of Rome</i>, and <i>pub.</i>, also with him,
<i>The Philological Museum</i> (1831-33). He was an advocate for the
admission of Dissenters to degrees, and in consequence of his action
in the matter had to resign his Univ. tutorship. Thereupon Lord
Brougham, then Lord Chancellor, presented him to the living of
Kirkby Underdale. Between 1835 and 1847 he wrote his great <i>History
of Greece</i>, which has a place among historical classics. In 1840
he was made Bishop of St. David's, in which capacity he showed unusual
energy in administering his see. The eleven charges which he
delivered during his tenure of the see were pronouncements of exceptional
weight upon the leading questions of the time affecting the
Church. As a Broad Churchman T. was regarded with suspicion by
both High and Low Churchmen, and in the House of Lords generally
supported liberal movements such as the admission of Jews to
Parliament. He was the only Bishop who was in favour of the disestablishment
of the Irish Church.</p><br />

<a name='THOMSON_JAMES_1700_1748'></a><p><b>THOMSON, JAMES (1700-1748).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of the minister
of Ednam, Roxburghshire, spent most of his youth, however, at
Southdean, a neighbouring parish, to which his <i>f.</i> was translated.
He was <i>ed.</i> at the parish school there, at Jedburgh, and at Edin.,
whither he went with the view of studying for the ministry. The
style of one of his earliest sermons having been objected to by the
Prof. of Divinity as being too flowery and imaginative, he gave up
his clerical views and went to London in 1725, taking with him a part
of what ultimately became his poem of <i>Winter</i>. By the influence of
his friend Mallet he became tutor to Lord Binning, <i>s.</i> of the Earl of
Haddington, and was introduced to Pope, Arbuthnot, Gay, and
others. <i>Winter</i> was <i>pub.</i> in 1726, and was followed by <i>Summer</i>
(1727), <i>Spring</i> (1728), and <i>Autumn</i> (1730), when the whole were
brought together as <i>The Seasons</i>. Previous to 1730 he had produced
one or two minor poems and the tragedy of <i>Sophonisba</i>, which,
after promising some success, was killed by the unfortunate line,
&quot;Oh! Sophonisba, Sophonisba, oh!&quot; being parodied as &quot;Oh!
Jemmy Thomson, Jemmy Thomson, oh!&quot; In 1731 T. accompanied
Charles Talbot, <i>s.</i> of the Lord Chancellor, to the Continent,
as tutor, and on his return received the sinecure Secretaryship of
Briefs which, however, he lost in 1737, through omitting to apply
for its continuance to Talbot's successor. He then returned to the
drama and produced <i>Agamemnon</i> in 1738, and <i>Edward and Eleanora</i>
in 1739. The same year he received from the Prince of Wales a
pension of &pound;100, and was made Surveyor-General of the Leeward
Islands which, after providing for a deputy to discharge the duties,
left him &pound;300 a year. He was now in comfortable circumstances
and settled in a villa near Richmond, where he amused himself with
gardening and seeing his friends. In conjunction with Mallet he wrote,
in 1740, the masque of <i>Alfred</i>, in which appeared <i>Rule Britannia</i>,
which M. afterwards claimed, or allowed to be claimed, for him,
but which there is every reason to believe was contributed by T. In
1745 appeared <i>Tancred and Sigismunda</i>, the most successful of his
dramas, and in 1748 <i>Coriolanus</i>. In May of the latter year he <i>pub.</i>
<i>The Castle of Indolence</i>, an allegorical poem in the Spenserian stanza,
generally considered to be his masterpiece. In August following he
caught a chill which developed into a fever, and carried him off in
his 48th year. Though T. was undoubtedly a poet by nature,
his art was developed by constant and fastidious polishing.
To <i>The Seasons</i>, originally containing about 4000 lines, he
added about 1400 in his various revisions. He was the first to
give the description of nature the leading place, and in his treatment
of his theme he showed much judgment in the selection of the details
to be dwelt upon. His blank verse, though not equal to that of
a few other English poets, is musical and wielded in a manner suitable
to his subject. In all his poems he displays the genial temper
and kindly sympathies by which he was characterised as a man.
He was never <i>m.</i>, and lived an easy, indolent life, beloved by his
many friends. (<i>See also</i> Lyttelton, Lord<a name='Page_381'></a>)</p><br />

publications. His best known poem is <i>The City of Dreadful Night</i>,
deeply pessimistic. Others are <i>Vane's Story</i> and <i>Weddah and Omel-Bonain</i>.

and he <i>d.</i> in poverty and misery. His work has a certain
gloomy power which renders it distinctly noteworthy.</p><br />

extraction, from Jersey, was a manufacturer of lead-pencils. He
was <i>ed.</i> at Harvard, where he became a good classical scholar. Subsequently
he was a competent Orientalist, and was deeply versed in
the history and manners of the Red Indians. No form of regular
remunerative employment commending itself to him, he spent the
10 years after leaving coll. in the study of books and nature, for the
latter of which he had exceptional qualifications in the acuteness of
his senses and his powers of observation. Though not a misanthropist,
he appears in general to have preferred solitary communion
with nature to human society. &quot;The man I meet,&quot; he said, &quot;is
seldom so instructive as the silence which he breaks;&quot; and he described
himself as &quot;a mystic, a transcendentalist, and a natural philosopher.&quot;
He made such money as his extremely simple mode of life
called for, by building boats or fences, agricultural or garden work,
and surveying, anything almost of an outdoor character which did
not involve lengthened engagement. In 1837 he began his diaries,
records of observation with which in ten years he filled 30 vols. In
1839 he made the excursion the record of which he in 1845 <i>pub.</i> as
<i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers</i>. Two years later, in
1841, he began a residence in the household of Emerson, which
lasted for two years, when he assisted in conducting the <i>Dial</i>, and
in 1845, after some teaching in New York, he retired to a hut near the
solitary Walden Pond to write his <i>Week on the Concord</i>, etc. Later
works were <i>Walden</i> (1854), and <i>The Maine Woods</i> (1864), and <i>Cape
Cod</i> (1865), accounts of excursions and observations, both <i>pub.</i> after
his death. T. was an enthusiast in the anti-slavery cause, the triumph
of which, however, he did not live to see, as he <i>d.</i> on May 6, 1862, when
the war was still in its earlier stages. The deliberate aim of T. was to
live a life as nearly approaching naturalness as possible; and to this
end he passed his time largely in solitude and in the open air. As he
says, &quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to
front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what
it had to teach.&quot; To his great powers of observation he added
great powers of reflection, and two of the most characteristic
features of his writings are immediateness and individuality in his
descriptions of nature, and a remarkable power of giving permanent
and clear form to the most subtle and evanescent mental impressions.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Bridekirk
Vicarage, Cumberland, and <i>ed.</i> at Oxf. became the friend of <a name='Page_382'></a><a href='#ADDISON_JOSEPH_1672_1719'>Joseph
Addison</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), contributed to the <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Guardian</i>, and
accompanied him when he went to Ireland as sec. to the Lord Lieutenant.
His translation of the first book of the <i>Iliad</i> came out at the
same time as Pope's, and led to a quarrel between the latter and
Addison, Pope imagining that the publication was a plot to interfere
with the success of his work. On Addison becoming Sec. of
State in 1717 he appointed T. Under-Sec. Among the writings of T.
are the well-known ballad, <i>Colin and Lucy</i>, <i>Kensington Gardens</i>, a
poem, and an <i>Elegy</i> on the death of Addison, of which Macaulay says
that it &quot;would do honour to the greatest name in our literature.&quot;
In 1725 he became sec. to the Lords Justices of Ireland, and retained
the post until his death.</p><br />

law. He, however, gave himself to study and writing, and also
travelled much. After being a Prof. at Harvard, 1819-35, he went
in the latter year to Europe, where he spent some years collecting
materials for his <i>magnum opus</i>, <i>The History of Spanish Literature</i>
(1849). He also wrote Lives of Lafayette and Prescott, the historian.
His <i>Letters and Journals</i> were <i>pub.</i> in 1876, and are the
most interesting of his writings.</p><br />

&mdash;Poet, <i>dau.</i> of
a clergyman, made an unhappy marriage, though she had beauty
and amiable manners, and was highly popular in society. She wrote
a good deal of verse; but her chief poem was a translation in Spenserian
stanza of the tale of <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>, which won the admiration
of such men as Sir J. Mackintosh, Moore, and Keats.</p><br />

<a name='TILLOTSON_JOHN_1630_1694'></a><p><b>TILLOTSON, JOHN (1630-1694).</b>
&mdash;Divine, <i>s.</i> of a Presbyterian
clothier, was <i>b.</i> near Halifax, and <i>ed.</i> at Camb., where his
originally Puritan views became somewhat modified. At the Savoy
Conference in 1661 he was still a Presbyterian, but submitted to the
Act of Uniformity, and became next year Rector of Keddington, and
in 1664 preacher at Lincoln's Inn, where he became very popular.
In 1672 he was made Dean of Canterbury. He vainly endeavoured
to secure the comprehension of the Nonconformists in the Church.
After the Revolution he gained the favour of William III., who
made him Clerk of the Closet, and Dean of St. Paul's, and in 1691 he
succeeded Sancroft as Archbishop of Canterbury. His sermons,
which had extraordinary popularity, give him a place in literature,
and he was one of those writers who, by greater simplicity and
greater attention to clearness of construction, helped to introduce
the modern style of composition.</p><br />

&mdash;Deistical writer, <i>b.</i> in
Ireland of Roman Catholic parentage, completed his education at
Glasgow, Edin., and Leyden. Very early in life he had become a
Protestant, and at Leyden he studied theology with the view of becoming
a Nonconformist minister, but imbibed Rationalistic views.
He then resided for some time at Oxf., and in 1696 <i>pub.</i> his first
work, <i>Christianity not Mysterious</i>, which was censured by Convocation
and gave rise to much controversy. Next year he returned to
Ireland, where, however, he was not more popular than in England,
and where his book was burned by the common hangman. Returning
to England he took to writing political pamphlets, including one,
<i>Anglia Libera</i>, in support of the Brunswick succession, which gained
him some favour at Hanover, and he was sent on some political
business to the German Courts. He then served Harley in Holland
and Germany practically as a political spy. His later years were
passed in literary drudgery and poverty. Among his numerous
writings may be mentioned <i>Account of Prussia and Hanover</i>, <i>Origines
Judaic&aelig;</i>, <i>History of the Druids</i>, and a Life of Milton prefixed to an
ed. of his prose works.</p><br />

&mdash;Philologist, <i>s.</i> of a
poulterer called Horne, added the name of Tooke in 1782 in anticipation
of inheriting from his friend W. Tooke, of Purley. He was at
Camb. and took orders, but disliking the clerical profession, travelled
abroad. Returning he became prominent as a radical politician, and
espoused the cause of Wilkes, with whom, however, he afterwards
quarrelled. He also supported the revolted American colonists, and
was fined and imprisoned for endeavouring to raise a subscription for
them. An effort to be admitted to the Bar was unsuccessful; and
in 1786 he published his <i>Diversions of Purley</i>, a work on philology
which brought him great reputation, and which, containing muck
that has been proved to be erroneous, showed great learning and
acuteness. T. twice endeavoured unsuccessfully to enter Parliament
for Westminster, but ultimately sat for the rotten burgh of Old
Sarum, making, however, no mark in the House. He was the author
of numerous effective political pamphlets.</p><br />

and became incumbent of Broad Hembury. He was a strong Calvinist
and entered into a bitter controversy with Wesley. His controversial

of English hymns.</p><br />

to Cadiz, returning from which he was disembarked with
the sick at Kinsale, where he <i>d.</i> He wrote two dramas, <i>The Revenger's
Tragedy</i> (<i>pr.</i> 1607), and <i>The Atheist's Tragedy</i> (<i>pr.</i> 1611), in
both of which, especially the former, every kind of guilt and horror
is piled up, the author displaying, however, great intensity of tragic
<a name='Page_384'></a>power. Of <i>The Revenger</i> Lamb said that it made his ears tingle.
Another play of his, <i>Transformed Metamorphosis</i>, was discovered in
1872.</p><br />

<a name='TRAHERNE_THOMAS_1636_1674'></a><p><b>TRAHERNE, THOMAS (1636?-1674).</b>
&mdash;Poet and theological
writer, <i>s.</i> of a shoemaker at Hereford where, or at Ledbury, he was
probably <i>b.</i> Very few facts concerning him have been preserved,
and indeed his very existence had been forgotten until some of his
MS. were discovered on a bookstall in 1896, without, however, anything
to identify the author. Their discoverer, Mr. W.T. Brooke,
was inclined to attribute them to <a href='#VAUGHAN_HENRY_1622_1695'>Henry Vaughan</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), in which he
was supported by <a href='#GROSART_ALEXANDER_BALLOCH_1827_1899'>Dr. Grosart</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), and the latter was about to
bring out a new ed. of Vaughan's poems in which they were to be included.
This was, however, prevented by his death. The credit of
identification is due to Mr. Bertram Dobell, who had become the
possessor of another vol. of MS., and who rejecting, after due consideration,
the claims of Vaughan, followed up the very slender clues
available until he had established the authorship of Traherne. All
the facts that his diligent investigations were successful in collecting
were that T. was &quot;entered as a commoner at Brasenose Coll., Oxf.,
in 1652, took one degree in arts, left the house for a time, entered into
the sacred function, and in 1661 was actually created M.A. About
that time he became Rector of Crednell, near Hereford ... and in
1669 Bachelor of Divinity;&quot; and that after remaining there for over
9 years he was appointed private chaplain to the Lord Keeper, Sir
Orlando Bridgeman, who on his retirement from office retained him
as a member of his household at Teddington until his death in 1674,
T. himself dying three months later. T. also appears to have been
incumbent of Teddington, or perhaps more probably, curate to a
pluralist incumbent. The complete oblivion into which T. had
fallen is the more remarkable when the quality of his poetry, which
places him on a level with Herbert, Vaughan, and Crashaw, is considered;
and that he appears in his own day to have had some reputation
as a scholar and controversialist. His <i>Roman Forgeries</i>
(1673) achieved some note. His next work, <i>Christian Ethics</i>, which
was not <i>pub.</i> until after his death, appears to have fallen dead, and
is extremely rare: it is described by Mr. Dobell as &quot;full of eloquence,
persuasiveness, sagacity, and piety.&quot; <i>Centuries of Meditations</i> consists
of short reflections on religious and moral subjects, etc. The
<i>Poems</i> constitute his main claim to remembrance and, as already
stated, are of a high order. With occasional roughness of metre
they display powerful imagination, a deep and rich vein of original
thought, and true poetic force and fire. It has been pointed out
that in some of them the author anticipates the essential doctrines
of the Berkeleian philosophy, and in them is also revealed a
personality of rare purity and fascination.</p><br />

entered the navy, from which, however, he deserted, after which he
wandered about in the East and on the Continent. In Switzerland
he met Byron and Shelley, and was living in close friendship with
the latter when he was drowned, and was one of the witnesses at the
cremation of his remains. He took part in the Greek war of independence,
and <i>m.</i> the sister of one of the insurgent chiefs. After
<a name='Page_385'></a>various adventures in America he settled in London, where he was a
distinguished figure in society, and enjoyed the reputation of a picturesque,
but somewhat imaginative, conversationalist. He wrote
<i>The Adventures of a Younger Son</i> (1831), a work of striking distinction,
and the intensely interesting <i>Records of Shelley, Byron, and the

and after serving various country parishes, became in 1847 Prof. of
Theology in King's Coll., London, in 1856 Dean of Westminster, and
in 1864 Archbishop of Dublin. As Primate of the Irish Church at
its disestablishment, he rendered valuable service at that time of
trial. In theology his best known works are his <i>Hulsean Lectures</i>,
<i>Notes on the Parables</i>, and <i>Notes on the Miracles</i>. His philological
writings, <i>English Past and Present</i> and <i>Select Glossary of English
Words</i> are extremely interesting and suggestive, though now to
some extent superseded. His <i>Sacred Latin Poetry</i> is a valuable collection
of medi&aelig;val Church hymns. He also wrote sonnets, elegies,
and lyrics, in the first of which he was specially successful, besides
longer poems, <i>Justin Martyr</i> and <i>Sabbation</i>.</p><br />

<i>ed.</i> at Harrow and Winchester. His childhood was an unhappy one,
owing to his father's misfortunes. After a short time in Belgium he
obtained an appointment in the Post Office, in which he rose to a responsible
position. His first three novels had little success; but in
1855 he found his line, and in <i>The Warden</i> produced the first of his
Barsetshire series. It was followed by <i>Barchester Towers</i> (1857),
<i>Doctor Thorne</i> (1858), <i>Framley Parsonage</i> (1861), <i>The Small House at
Allington</i> (1864), and <i>The Last Chronicle of Barset</i> (1867), which deal
with the society of a small cathedral city. Other novels are <i>Orley
Farm</i>, <i>Can you forgive Her?</i>, <i>Ralph the Heir</i>, <i>The Claverings</i>, <i>Phineas
Finn</i>, <i>He knew he was Right</i>, and <i>The Golden Lion of Grandpr&eacute;</i>. In
all he wrote about 50 novels, besides books about the West Indies,
North America, Australia, and South Africa, a translation of <i>C&aelig;sar</i>,
and monographs on Cicero and Thackeray. His novels are light of
touch, pleasant, amusing, and thoroughly healthy. They make no
attempt to sound the depths of character or either to propound or
solve problems. Outside of fiction his work was generally superficial
and unsatisfactory. But he had the merit of providing a whole
generation with wholesome amusement, and enjoyed a great deal of
popularity. He is said to have received &pound;70,000 for his writings<a name='Page_386'></a>.</p><br />

She then in 1827 went with her family to Cincinnati, where the efforts
which she made to support herself were unsuccessful. On her return
to England, however, she brought herself into notice by publishing
<i>Domestic Manners of the Americans</i> (1832), in which she gave a very
unfavourable and grossly exaggerated account of the subject; and
a novel, <i>The Refugee in America</i>, pursued it on similar lines. Next
came <i>The Abbess</i> and <i>Belgium and Western Germany</i>, and other
works of the same kind on <i>Paris and the Parisians</i>, and <i>Vienna and
the Austrians</i> followed. Thereafter she continued to pour forth
novels and books on miscellaneous subjects, writing in all over 100
vols. Though possessed of considerable powers of observation and
a sharp and caustic wit, such an output was fatal to permanent
literary success, and none of her books are now read. She spent the
last 20 years of her life at Florence, where she <i>d.</i> in 1863. Her third
<i>s.</i> was <a href='#TROLLOPE_ANTHONY_1815_1882'>Anthony T.</a>, the well-known novelist (<i>q.v.</i>). Her eldest <i>s.</i>,

and called to the Bar in 1835. He, however, believed that literature
was his vocation, and wrote many works in prose and verse, only one
of which, <i>Proverbial Philosophy</i>, had much success. But the vogue
which it had was enormous, especially in America. It is a singular
collection of commonplace observations set forth in a form which
bears the appearance of verse, but has neither rhyme nor metre, and
has long since found its deserved level. He also wrote <i>War Ballads</i>,
<i>Rifle Ballads</i>, and <i>Protestant Ballads</i>, various novels, and an autobiography.

of the Anglo-Saxons</i> (1799-1805). Thereafter he continued the
narrative in <i>History of England</i> (1814-29), carrying it on to the end
of the reign of Elizabeth. These histories, especially the former,
though somewhat marred by an attempt to emulate the grandiose
style of Gibbon, were works of real research, and opened up, and to
a considerable extent developed, a new field of inquiry. T. also
wrote a <i>Sacred History of the World</i>, and a poem on Richard III.</p><br />

was an Essex man. Having a good voice he was trained in music,
and was a chorister in St. Paul's, and afterwards in Norwich Cathedral,
and held the post of musician to Lord Paget. He tried farming
at different places, but unsuccessfully, which did not, however,
prevent his undertaking to instruct others. This he does with much
shrewdness and point in his <i>Hundreth Goode Pointes of Husbandrie</i>
(1557), expressed in rude but lively verse; thereafter he added <i>Hundreth
Goode Pointes of Husserie</i> (Housewifery). The two joined, and
with many additions, were repeatedly reprinted as <i>Five Hundredth
Pointes of Goode Husbandrie united to as many of Goode Huswifery</i>.
Many proverbs may be traced back to the writings of T., who, in

<a name='TYNDALE_WILLIAM_1484_1536'></a><p><b>TYNDALE, WILLIAM (1484?-1536).</b>
&mdash;Translator of the
Bible, belonged to a northern family which, migrating to Gloucestershire
during the Wars of the Roses, adopted the alternative name of
Huchyns or Hychins, which T. himself bore when at Oxf. in 1510.
After graduating there, he went to Camb., where the influence of
Erasmus, who had been Prof. of Theology, still operated. He took
orders, and in 1522 was a tutor in the household of Sir John Walsh of
Old Sodbury, and was preaching and disputing in the country round,
for which he was called to account by the Chancellor of the diocese.
At the same time he translated a treatise by Erasmus, the <i>Enchiridion
Militis Christiani</i> (Manual of the Christian Soldier), and in controversy
with a local disputant prophesied that he would cause that
&quot;a boye that driveth the plough&quot; should know the Scriptures
better than his opponent. Having formed the purpose of translating
the New Testament T. went in 1523 to London, and used means
towards his admission to the household of Tunstal, Bishop of London,
but without success; he then lived in the house of a wealthy
draper, Humphrey Monmouth, where he probably began his translation.
Finding, however, that his work was likely to be interfered
with, he proceeded in 1524 to Hamburg, whence he went to visit
Luther at Wittenberg. He began printing his translation at
Cologne the following year, but had to fly to Worms, where the work
was completed. The translation itself is entirely T.'s work, and is
that of a thorough scholar, and shows likewise an ear for the harmony
of words. The notes and introduction are partly his own,
partly literal translations, and partly the gist of the work of Luther.
From Germany the translation was introduced into England, and
largely circulated until forcible means of prevention were brought
to bear in 1528. In this year T. removed to Marburg, where he <i>pub.</i>
<i>The Parable of the Wicked Mammon</i>, a treatise on Justification by
Faith, and <i>The Obedience of a Christian Man</i>, setting forth that
Scripture is the ultimate authority in matters of faith, and the King
in matters of civil government. Thereafter, having been at Hamburg
and Antwerp, T. returned to Marburg, and in 1530 <i>pub.</i> his
translation of the <i>Pentateuch</i> and <i>The Practice of Prelates</i>, in which
he attacked Wolsey and the proposed divorce proceedings of Henry
VIII., the latter of whom endeavoured to have him apprehended.
Thereafter he was involved in a controversy with Sir Thomas More.
In 1533 he returned to Antwerp, Henry's hostility having somewhat
cooled, and was occupied in revising his translations, when he was
in 1535 betrayed into the hands of the Imperial officers and carried
off to the Castle of Vilvorde, where the next year he was strangled
and burned. T. was one of the most able and devoted of the reforming
leaders, and his, the foundation of all future translations of the
Bible, is his enduring monument. He was a small, thin man of
abstemious habits and untiring industry.</p><br />

ordnance survey and as a railway engineer. He was next teacher
of mathematics and surveying at Queenwood Coll., Hampshire,
after which he went to Marburg to study science, and while there
became joint author of a memoir <i>On the Magneto-optic Properties of<a name='Page_389'></a>

and in 1853 was appointed Prof. of Natural Philosophy in the
Royal Institution, which in 1867 he succeeded Faraday as Superintendent.
With <a href='#HUXLEY_THOMAS_HENRY_1825_1895'>Huxley</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) he made investigations into the Alpine
glaciers. Thereafter he did much original work on heat, sound, and
light. In addition to his discoveries T. was one of the greatest
popularisers of science. His style, remarkable for lucidity and
elegance, enabled him to expound such subjects with the minimum
of technical terminology. Among his works are <i>The Glaciers of the
Alps</i> (1860), <i>Mountaineering</i> (1861), <i>Fragments of Science</i>, two vols.
(1871), including his address to the British Association at Belfast,
which raised a storm of controversy and protest in various quarters,

opposed to the Covenanters, and fought against them at Turriff in
1639. His later life was passed between Scotland, England (where
he was for some time a prisoner in the Tower), and the Continent,
where he lived, 1642-45. A man of considerable ability and learning,
his vanity and eccentricity verged upon insanity, and he is
said to have <i>d.</i> from the effects of an uncontrollable fit of joyful
laughter on hearing news of the Restoration. Among his extravagances
was a genealogy of his family traced through his <i>f.</i> to

and became Chancellor of St. Patrick's, Dublin, 1605, and Prof. of
Divinity, 1607-21. On the Irish clergy, in 1715, deciding to assert
themselves as an independent church, U. had the main hand in
drawing up the constitution, certain features of which led to the
suspicion of his being in favour of Puritanism. To defend himself
he went in 1619 to England, and had a conference with the King
(James I.), in which he so completely succeeded that he was in 1621
made Bishop of Meath, and four years later Archbishop of Armagh.
He constantly used his influence in favour of reform, and endeavoured
to introduce such modifications of Episcopacy as would
conciliate and comprehend the Presbyterians. During the troubles
which led to the Civil War U. maintained the unlawfulness of taking
up arms against the King. The Rebellion in Ireland in 1641 drove
him away, and he settled first at Oxf., but ultimately at the house of
Lady Peterborough at Reigate, where he <i>d.</i> in 1656. His works
dealt chiefly with ecclesiastical antiquities and chronology, his
<i>magnum opus</i> being <i>Annales</i>, a chronology of the world from the
creation to the dispersion of the Jews in the reign of Vespasian, a
work which gained him great reputation on the Continent as well as
at home. The date of the creation was fixed as 4004 B.C., which was
long universally received. It has, of course, been altogether superseded,
alike by the discovery of ancient records, and by geology.</p><br />

The next year he got a commission in the army, and in 1690 he was
a prisoner first at Vincennes and then in the Bastille. In 1696 he
began his dramatic career with <i>The Relapse</i>, which had great success.
<i>&AElig;sop</i> followed in 1697, and <i>The Provoked Wife</i> in the same year.
The latter was severely handled by <a href='#COLLIER_JEREMY_1650_1726'>Jeremy Collier</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) in his <i>Short
View</i>, etc., which produced a vindication by the author. In addition
to these he wrote or collaborated in various other plays. His
leading features as a dramatist are the naturalness of his dialogue
and his lively humour. Like all his contemporaries he is frequently
extremely gross. He obtained great fame as an architect, as well
as a dramatist. Among his most famous designs are Castle Howard,
Blenheim Palace, and Dalkeith Palace. He was knighted by George
I., was controller of the Royal works, and succeeded Wren as architect
to Greenwich Hospital. In addition to the plays above mentioned

studied law in London, but finally settled as a physician at Brecon
and Newton-by-Usk. In his youth he was a decided Royalist and,
along with his twin brother Thomas, was imprisoned. His first book
was <i>Poems, with the Tenth Satire of Juvenal Englished</i>. It appeared
in 1646. <i>Olor Iscanus</i> (the Swan of Usk), a collection of poems and
translations, was surreptitiously <i>pub.</i> in 1651. About this time he
had a serious illness which led to deep spiritual impressions, and
thereafter his writings were almost entirely religious. <i>Silex
Scintillans</i>
(Sparks from the Flint), his best known work, consists of
short poems full of deep religious feeling, fine fancy, and exquisite
felicities of expression, mixed with a good deal that is quaint and
artificial. It contains &quot;The Retreat,&quot; a poem of about 30 lines
which manifestly suggested to Wordsworth his <i>Ode on the Intimations
of Immortality</i>, and &quot;Beyond the Veil,&quot; one of the finest meditative
poems in the language. <i>Flores Solitudinis</i> (Flowers of Solitude)
and <i>The Mount of Olives</i> are devout meditations in prose. The
two brothers were joint authors of <i>Thalia Rediviva: the Pastimes

<a name='WALLER_EDMUND_1606_1687'></a><p><b>WALLER, EDMUND (1606-1687).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> at Coleshill,
Herts, and <i>ed.</i> at Eton and Camb., belonged to an old and wealthy
family, and in early childhood inherited the estate of Beaconsfield,
Bucks, worth &pound;3500 a year. He was related to John Hampden, and
was distantly connected with Oliver Cromwell, his own family,
however, being staunch Royalists. He studied law at Lincoln's
Inn, and at the age of 16 became a member of Parliament, in which
he sat for various constituencies for the greater part of his life, and
in which his wit and vivacity, as well as his powers of adapting his
principles to the times, enabled him to take a prominent part. In
1631 he added to his fortune by marrying Anne Banks, a London
heiress, who <i>d.</i> in 1634, and he then paid assiduous but unsuccessful
court to Lady Dorothea Sidney, to whom, under the name of
Sacharissa, he addressed much of his best poetry. Though probably
really a Royalist in his sympathies, W. supported the popular
<a name='Page_393'></a>cause in Parliament, and in 1641 conducted the case against Sir
Francis Crawley for his opinion in favour of the legality of ship-money.
His speech, which was printed, had an enormous circulation
and brought him great fame. Two years later, however, he
was detected in a plot for seizing London for the King, was expelled
from the House, fined &pound;10,000, and banished. On this occasion he
showed cowardice and treachery, humiliating himself in the most
abject manner, and betraying all his associates. He went to the
Continent, living chiefly in France and Switzerland, and showing
hospitality to Royalist exiles. Returning by permission in 1652 he
addressed some laudatory verses, among the best he wrote, to Cromwell,
on whose death nevertheless he wrote a new poem entitled, <i>On
the Death of the late Usurper, O.C.</i> On the Restoration the accommodating
poet was ready with a congratulatory address to Charles
II., who, pointing out its inferiority as a poem to that addressed to
Cromwell, elicited the famous reply, &quot;Poets, Sire, succeed better in
fiction than in truth.&quot; The poem, however, whatever its demerits,
succeeded in its prime object, and the poet became a favourite at
Court, and sat in Parliament until his death. In addition to his
lighter pieces, on which his fame chiefly rests, W. wrote an epic, <i>The
Summer Islands</i> (Bermudas), and a sacred poem, <i>Divine Love</i>. His
short poems, such as &quot;On a Girdle,&quot; often show fancy and grace
of expression, but are frequently frigid and artificial, and exhibit
absolute indifference to the charms of Nature. As a man, though
agreeable and witty, he was time-serving, selfish, and cowardly.
Clarendon has left a very unflattering &quot;character&quot; of him. He <i>m.</i>

earlier years little is known. He carried on business as a hosier in
London, in which he made a modest competence, which enabled
him to retire at 50, the rest of his long life of 90 years being spent in
the simple country pleasures, especially angling, which he so charmingly
describes. He was twice <i>m.</i>, first to Rachel Floud, a descendant
of Archbishop Cranmer, and second to Ann Ken, half-sister of
the author of the Evening Hymn. His first book was a <i>Life of Dr.
Donne</i> (1640), followed by Lives of Sir Henry Wotton (1651),
Richard Hooker (1662), George Herbert (1670), and Bishop Sanderson
(1678). All of these, classics in their kind, short, but simple and
striking, were <i>coll.</i> into one vol. His masterpiece, however, was <i>The

presented to the Rectory of Brand-Broughton, where he remained
for many years. His first important work was <i>The Alliance between

entirely eclipsed by his <i>Divine Legation of Moses</i>, of which the first
part appeared in 1737, and the second in 1741. The work, though
learned and able, is somewhat paradoxical, and it plunged him into

chaplain to Frederick, Prince of Wales. In 1739 W. gained the
friendship of Pope by publishing a defence of <i>The Essay on Man</i>.
Through Pope he became acquainted with most of the men of letters
of the time, and he was made by the poet his literary executor, and
had the legacy of half his library, and the profits of his posthumous
works. On the strength of this he brought out an ed. of Pope's works.
He also <i>pub.</i> an ed. of Shakespeare with notes, which was somewhat
severely criticised, and his <i>Doctrine of Grace</i>, a polemic against
Wesley. He became Dean of Bristol in 1757 and Bishop of Gloucester
in 1759. W. was a man of powerful intellect, but his temper
was overbearing and arrogant.</p><br />

<a name='WARNER_WILLIAM_1558_1609'></a><p><b>WARNER, WILLIAM (1558-1609).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> in London or
Yorkshire, studied at Oxf., and was an attorney in London. In<a name='Page_396'></a>
1585 he <i>pub.</i> a collection of seven tales in prose entitled <i>Pan his
Syrinx</i>, and in 1595 a translation of the <i>Men&aelig;chmi</i> of Plautus. His
chief work was <i>Albion's England</i>, <i>pub.</i> in 1586 in 13 books of fourteen-syllabled
verse, and republished with 3 additional books in 1606.
The title is thus explained in the dedication, &quot;This our whole island
anciently called Britain, but more anciently Albion, presently containing
two kingdoms, England and Scotland, is cause ... that to
distinguish the former, whose only occurrants I abridge from our
history, I entitle this my book <i>Albion's England</i>.&quot; For about 20
years it was one of the most popular poems of its size&mdash;it contains
about 10,000 lines&mdash;ever written, and he and Spenser were called
the Homer and Virgil of their age. They must, however, have appealed
to quite different classes. The plain-spoken, jolly humour,
homely, lively, direct tales, vigorous patriotic feeling, and rough-and-tumble
metre of Warner's muse, and its heterogeneous accumulation
of material&mdash;history, tales, theology, antiquities&mdash;must have
appealed to a lower and wider audience than Spenser's charmed
verse. The style is clear, spirited, and pointed, but, as has been
said, &quot;with all its force and vivacity ... fancy at times, and
graphic descriptive power, it is poetry with as little of high imagination
in it as any that was ever written.&quot; In his narratives W. allowed
himself great latitude of expression, which may partly account for
the rapidity with which his book fell into oblivion.</p><br />

and in 1852 was made Recorder of Hull. He sat in the House
of Commons for Midhurst 1856-59, and was a Master in Lunacy 1859-77.
He was the author of <i>Passages from the Diary of a late Physician</i>,
which appeared (1832-37) first in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, as did also
<i>Ten Thousand a Year</i> (1839). Both attracted considerable attention,
and were often reprinted and translated. His last novel, <i>Now

<i>pub.</i> miscellaneous verses, 2 vols. of <i>Odes</i> (1744 and 1746), in which
he displayed a then unusual feeling for nature, and revolted against
the critical rules of Pope and his followers. He was a good classical
scholar, and made an approved translation of the <i>Eclogues</i> and
<i>Georgics</i> of Virgil. He and his brother <a href='#WARTON_THOMAS_1728_1790'>Thomas</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) were friends of

<a name='Page_397'></a>of the above, was <i>ed.</i> under his <i>f.</i> at Basingstoke and at Oxf. At the
age of 19 he <i>pub.</i> a poem of considerable promise, <i>The Pleasures of
Melancholy</i>, and two years later attracted attention by <i>The Triumph
of Isis</i> (1749), in praise of Oxf., and in answer to Mason's <i>Isis</i>.
After various other poetical excursions he <i>pub.</i> <i>Observations on
Spenser's Faery Queen</i> (1754), which greatly increased his reputation,
and in 1757 he was made Prof. of Poetry at Oxf., which position he
held for 10 years. After bringing out one or two ed. of classics and
biographies of college benefactors, he issued, from 1774-81, his great
<i>History of English Poetry</i>, which comes down to the end of the
Elizabethan age. The research and judgment, and the stores of
learning often curious and recondite, which were brought to bear
upon its production render this work, though now in various
respects superseded, a vast magazine of information, and it did
much to restore our older poetry to the place of which it had been
unjustly deprived by the classical school. His ed. of Milton's minor
poems has been pronounced by competent critics to be the best ever
produced. W. was a clergyman, but if the tradition is to be believed
that he had only two sermons, one written by his <i>f.</i> and the other
printed, and if the love of ease and of ale which he celebrates in some
of his verses was other than poetical, he was more in his place as a
critic than as a cleric. As a poet he hardly came up to his own
standards. He was made Poet Laureate in 1785, and in the same
year Camden Prof. of History, and was one of the first to detect the
Chatterton forgeries, a task in which his antiquarian lore stood him
in good stead.</p><br />

<a name='WEBSTER_JOHN_1580_1625'></a><p><b>WEBSTER, JOHN (1580?-1625?).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist. Though in
some respects he came nearest to Shakespeare of any of his contemporaries,
almost nothing has come down to us of the life of W.
Even the dates of his birth and death are uncertain. He appears to
have been the <i>s.</i> of a London tailor, to have been a freeman of the
Merchant Taylor's Company, and clerk of the parish of St. Andrews,
Holborn. Four plays are known to be his, <i>The White Devil, or the
Life and Death of Vittoria Corombona</i> (1612), <i>Appius and Virginia</i>
(1654), <i>The Devil's Law Case</i> (1623), and <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> (1623),
and he collaborated with Drayton, Middleton, Heywood, Dekker, etc.,
in the production of others. He does not appear to have been much
regarded in his own day, and it was only in the 19th century that his
great powers began to be appreciated and expounded by such
critics as Lamb and Hazlitt, and in later days Swinburne. The
first says, &quot;To move a horror skilfully, to touch a soul to the quick,
to lay upon fear as much as it can bear, to wean and weary a life till
it is ready to drop, and then step in with mortal instruments to take
its last forfeit, this only a Webster can do.&quot; W. revels in the
horrible, but the touch of genius saves his work from mere brutality,
and evokes pity and sorrow where, without it, there would be only
horror and disgust. His work is extremely unequal, and he had no
power of construction, but his extraordinary insight into motives
and feelings redeem all his failings and give him a place second only
to Marlowe and Ben Jonson among the contemporaries of Shakespeare.</p><br />

biblical drama, <i>Joseph and his Brethren</i> (1824), which had an almost
similar fate until D.G. Rossetti called attention to it in 1863, giving
it a high meed of praise. In 1874, stung by want of appreciation, he
had burned his manuscripts of plays and poems; but on the new

School and Oxf. He was all his life closely associated with his elder
and greater brother, one of whose most loyal helpers he was, though
not agreeing with him in all points. His chief fame is founded upon
his hymns, of which he is said to have written the almost incredible
number of 6500, many of them among the finest in the language.
They include &quot;Jesus, Lover of my Soul,&quot; &quot;Love Divine all Loves
excelling,&quot; &quot;Come, oh Thou Traveller Unknown,&quot; &quot;Hark the

<a name='WESLEY_JOHN_1703_1791'></a><p><b>WESLEY, JOHN (1703-1791).</b>
&mdash;Theological writer, diarist,
and founder of Methodism, was the second surviving <i>s.</i> of the Rev.
Samuel W., Rector of Epworth, Lincolnshire. The name was also
written Westley and Wellesley, and the family appears to be the
same as that to which the Duke of Wellington and his brother the
Marquis Wellesley belonged. W. was <i>ed.</i> at the Charterhouse and
at Oxf., and was ordained deacon in 1725, and priest in 1728. After
assisting his <i>f.</i> for a short time as curate, he returned to Oxf., where
he found that his brother <a href='#WESLEY_CHARLES_1707_1788'>Charles</a>, along with G. Whitefield (<i>q.v.</i>)
and others, had begun that association for religious improvement
from which sprang the great religious movement known as Methodism.
About the same time the two brothers came under the influence
of <a href='#LAW_WILLIAM_1686_1761'>William Law</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), author of the <i>Serious Call</i>, and in 1735
John went on a mission to Georgia to preach to the Indians and
colonists, and became closely associated with the Moravian Brethren.
Difficulties of a personal character, however, led to his return in
1738 to London, where he continued to associate with the Moravians.<a name='Page_401'></a>
It was at this time that, hearing Luther's preface to the Epistle to the
Romans read at a meeting, he found his religious and ecclesiastical
views revolutionised. Hitherto holding strong High Church views
in some directions, he now assumed a position which ultimately led
to his abandoning the doctrine of Apostolical succession, and ordaining
pastors and bishops, and finally creating a separate ecclesiastical
organisation. Consequences soon followed; the pulpits of the
Church were closed against him, and he began his marvellous career
of itinerant and out-of-door preaching, which was continued to the
close of his long life. He soon became a mighty power in the land;
vast crowds waited on his ministrations, which were instrumental
in producing a great revival of religious interest, and improved
morality among the people. At the same time violent opposition
was aroused, and W. was often in danger of his life from mobs. In
the end, however, he lived down this state of things to a large extent,
and in his old age was the object of extraordinary general veneration,
while in his own communion he exercised a kind of pontifical sway.
During the 50 years of his apostolic journeyings he is said to have
travelled 250,000 miles in Britain, Ireland, and the Continent; but
notwithstanding this phenomenal activity he was able, by extreme
economy of time, to write copiously, his works including educational
treatises, translations from the classics, histories of Rome and England,
a history of the Church, biblical commentaries, manifold controversial
treatises and ed. of religious classics. Most of them had
an enormous circulation and brought him in &pound;30,000, all of which he
expended on philanthropic and religious objects. The work, however,
on which his literary fame chiefly rests is his <i>Journal</i>, extending
from 1735-90, which is one of the most graphic and interesting
records of its kind in existence. He also wrote many hymns,
largely translations from the German, and he had a considerable,
hand in giving their final form to the almost innumerable hymns of
his brother Charles. W. was a man of practical and organising
ability of the first order, of intense religious earnestness and sincerity,
benevolent feelings, and agreeable manners. At the same
time he was of an autocratic temper, and often showed keenness and
even intolerance in his controversies, which were largely against the
extreme Calvinism of his old friend and fellow-labourer, Whitefield,
and Toplady, the author of the hymn &quot;Rock of Ages,&quot; himself a
bitter polemic. In 1740 he had formally withdrawn from association
with the Moravians. W. was <i>m.</i> in 1751 to a widow, Mrs.
Vazeille, with whom, however, he did not live happily, and who
separated from him in 1776.</p><br />

<a name='WHATELEY_RICHARD_1787_1863'></a><p><b>WHATELEY, RICHARD (1787-1863).</b>
&mdash;Theologian and
economist, <i>s.</i> of the Rev. Dr. Joseph W., <i>b.</i> in London, and <i>ed.</i> at a
school in Bristol, and at Oxf., where he became a coll. tutor. Taking
orders he became Rector of Halesworth, Suffolk. In 1822 he delivered
his Bampton lectures on <i>The Use and Abuse of Party Feeling
in Religion</i>. Three years later he was made Principal of St. Alban's
Hall, in 1829 Prof. of Political Economy, and in 1831 Archbishop of
Dublin. As head of a coll. and as a prelate W. showed great energy
and administrative ability. He was a vigorous, clear-headed personality,
somewhat largely endowed with contempt for views with
which he was not in sympathy, and with a vein of caustic humour, in
the use of which he was not sparing. These qualities made him far
from universally popular; but his honesty, fairness, and devotion to
duty gained for him general respect. He had no sympathy with the
Oxf. movement, was strongly anti-Calvinistic, and somewhat Latitudinarian,
so that he was exposed to a good deal of theological
odium from opposite quarters. He was a voluminous writer, and
among his best known works are his treatises on <i>Logic</i> (1826) and
<i>Rhetoric</i> (1828), his <i>Historic Doubts relative to Napoleon Buonaparte</i>
(1819), intended as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of Hume's contention
that no evidence is sufficient to prove a miracle, <i>Essays on some
Peculiarities of the Christian Religion</i> (1825), <i>Christian Evidences</i>
(1837), and ed. of Bacon's <i>Essays</i> with valuable notes, and of
Paley's <i>Evidences</i>.</p><br />

later served as a soldier in the Low Countries, accompanied
Sir Humphrey Gilbert's expedition to Newfoundland in 1578, and
was at the Battle of Zutphen in 1586. He was a trenchant critic of
the contemporary drama, contending for greater reality and rationality.
His play, <i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, translated from Cinthio's

<a name='WHEWELL_WILLIAM_1794_1866'></a><p><b>WHEWELL, WILLIAM (1794-1866).</b>
&mdash;Philosopher, theologian

was <i>b.</i>, <i>ed.</i> at Camb., where he had a brilliant career. He became
Prof. of Mineralogy at Camb. 1828, of Moral Theology 1838, was
Master of Trinity from 1841 until his death, and he held the office of
Vice-Chancellor of the Univ. in 1843 and 1856. W. was remarkable
as the possessor of an encyclop&aelig;dic fund of knowledge, perhaps unprecedented,
and he was the author of a number of works of great
importance on a variety of subjects. Among the chief of these may
be mentioned his Bridgewater Treatise on <i>Astronomy and General
Physics considered with Reference to Natural Theology</i> (1833), <i>History
of the Inductive Sciences</i> (1837), <i>The Philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences</i> (1840), <i>Essay on Plurality of Worlds</i> (anonymously), <i>Elements
of Morality</i> (1845), <i>History of Moral Philosophy in England</i><a name='Page_403'></a>
(1852), and <i>Platonic Dialogues</i>. In addition to these he wrote
innumerable articles, reviews, and scientific papers. It was as a
co-ordinator of knowledge and the researches of others that W.
excelled; he was little of an original observer or discoverer. He is
described as a large, strong, erect man with a red face and a loud
voice, and he was an overwhelming and somewhat arrogant talker.</p><br />

He was of liberal views, and is reckoned among the Camb. Platonists,
over whom he exercised great influence. His works consist of <i>Discourses</i>
and <i>Moral and Religious Aphorisms</i>. In 1668 he was presented

prominent advocate of the Newtonian system, and wrote a <i>Theory
of the Earth</i> against the views of <a href='#BURNET_THOMAS_1635_1715'>Thomas Burnet</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). He also
wrote several theological works, <i>Primitive Christianity Revived</i> and
the <i>Primitive New Testament</i>. The Arian views promulgated in the

&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a butcher
at Nottingham. At first assisting his <i>f.</i>, next a stocking weaver, he
was afterwards placed in the office of an attorney. Some contributions
to a newspaper introduced him to the notice of Capel Lofft, a
patron of promising youths, by whose help he brought out a vol. of
poems, which fell into the hands of Southey, who wrote to him.
Thereafter friends raised a fund to send him to Camb., where he gave
brilliant promise. Overwork, however, undermined a constitution
originally delicate, and he <i>d.</i> at 21. Southey wrote a short memoir
<a name='Page_404'></a>of him with some additional poems. His chief poem was the <i>Christiad</i>,
a fragment. His best known production is the hymn, &quot;Much
in sorrow, oft in Woe.&quot;</p><br />

<a name='WHITE_JOSEPH_BLANCO_1775_1841'></a><p><b>WHITE, JOSEPH BLANCO (1775-1841).</b>

<i>b.</i>, became a priest, but lost his religious faith and came to England,
where he conducted a Spanish newspaper having for its main object
the fanning of the flame of Spanish patriotism against the French
invasion, which was subsidised by the English Government. He
again embraced Christianity, and entered the Church of England,
but latterly became a Unitarian. He wrote, among other works,
<i>Internal Evidences against Catholicism</i> (1825), and <i>Second Travels of
an Irish Gentleman in search of a Religion</i>, in answer to T. Moore's
work, <i>Travels, etc.</i> His most permanent contribution to literature,
however, is his single sonnet on &quot;Night&quot;, which Coleridge considered

met with popular favour: <i>The Solitary</i> (1831), a poem, <i>The Autobiography
of Jack Ketch</i> (1834), a novel, and <i>The Cavalier</i> (1836), a
play in blank verse. He recommended Dickens for the writing

developed into <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>.</p><br />

<a name='WHITEHEAD_WILLIAM_1715_1785'></a><p><b>WHITEHEAD, WILLIAM (1715-1785).</b>

at Camb., and <i>ed.</i> at Winchester School and Camb., became tutor in
the family of the Earl of Jersey, and retained the favour of the family
through life. In 1757 he succeeded Colley Cibber as Poet Laureate.
He wrote plays of only moderate quality, including <i>The Roman
Father</i> and <i>Creusa</i>, tragedies, and <i>The School for Lovers</i>, a comedy;
also poems, <i>The Enthusiast</i> and <i>Variety</i>. His official productions as
Laureate were severely attacked, which drew from him in reply <i>A

<a name='WHITMAN_WALTER_or_WALT_1819_1892'></a><p><b>WHITMAN, WALTER or WALT (1819-1892).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i>
at Huntingdon, Long Island, New York. His mother was of Dutch
descent, and the farm on which he was <i>b.</i> had been in the possession
of his father's family since the early settlement. His first education
was received at Brooklyn, to which his <i>f.</i> had removed while W. was
a young child. At 13 he was in a printing office, at 17 he was teaching
and writing for the newspapers, and at 21 was editing one. The
next dozen years were passed in desultory work as a printer with
<a name='Page_405'></a>occasional literary excursions, but apparently mainly in &quot;loafing&quot;
and observing his fellow-creatures. It was not till 1855 that his
first really characteristic work, <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, appeared. This first
ed. contained only 12 poems. Notwithstanding its startling departures
from conventionality both in form and substance it was well
received by the leading literary reviews and, with certain reserves to
be expected, it was welcomed by Emerson. It did not, however,
achieve general acceptance, and was received with strong and not
unnatural protest in many quarters. When a later ed. was called for
Emerson unsuccessfully endeavoured to persuade the author to suppress
the more objectionable parts. On the outbreak of the Civil
War W. volunteered as a nurse for the wounded, and rendered much
useful service. The results of his experiences and observations were
given in verse in <i>Drum Taps</i> and <i>The Wound Dresser</i>, and in prose in
<i>Specimen Days</i>. From these scenes he was removed by his appointment
to a Government clerkship, from which, however, he was soon
dismissed on the ground of having written books of an immoral
tendency. This action of the authorities led to a somewhat warm
controversy, and after a short interval W. received another Government
appointment, which he held until 1873, when he had a paralytic
seizure, which rendered his retirement necessary. Other works
besides those mentioned are <i>Two Rivulets</i> and <i>Democratic Vistas</i>. In
his later years he retired to Camden, New Jersey, where he <i>d.</i> W. is
the most unconventional of writers. Revolt against all convention
was in fact his self-proclaimed mission. In his versification he discards
rhyme almost entirely, and metre as generally understood.
And in his treatment of certain passions and appetites, and of
unadulterated human nature, he is at war with what he considered
the conventions of an effeminate society, in which, however, he
adopts a mode of utterance which many people consider equally
objectionable, overlooking, as he does, the existence through all the
processes of nature of a principle of reserve and concealment. Amid
much that is prosaic and rhetorical, however, it remains true that
there is real poetic insight and an intense and singularly fresh sense
of nature in the best of his writings.</p>

<a name='WHITTIER_JOHN_GREENLEAF_1807_1892'></a><p><b>WHITTIER, JOHN GREENLEAF (1807-1892).</b>
&mdash;Poet, was <i>b.</i>
at Haverhill, Massachusetts, of a Quaker family. In early life he
worked on a farm. His later years were occupied partly in journalism,
partly in farming, and he seems also to have done a good deal
of local political work. He began to write verse at a very early age,
and continued to do so until almost his latest days. He was always
a champion of the anti-slavery cause, and by his writings both as
journalist and poet, did much to stimulate national feeling in the
direction of freedom. Among his poetical works are <i>Voices of Freedom</i>
(1836), <i>Songs of Labour</i> (1851), <i>Home Ballads</i> (1859), <i>In War
Time</i> (1863), <i>Snow Bound</i> (1866), <i>The Tent on the Beach</i> (1867),<a name='Page_406'></a>
<i>Ballads of New England</i> (1870), <i>The Pennsylvania Pilgrim</i> (1874).
W. had true feeling and was animated by high ideals. Influenced
in early life by the poems of Burns, he became a poet of nature, with
which his early upbringing brought him into close and sympathetic
contact; he was also a poet of faith and the ideal life and of liberty.
He, however, lacked concentration and intensity, and his want of
early education made him often loose in expression and faulty in
form; and probably a comparatively small portion of what he wrote
will live.</p><br />

army, and saw service in the Crimea, retiring in 1859 as Major.
Thereafter he devoted himself to field sports, in which he was an
acknowledged authority, and to literature. He wrote a number of
novels, mainly founded on sporting subjects, though a few were
historical. They include <i>Kate Coventry</i>, <i>The Queen's Maries</i>, <i>The
Gladiators</i>, and <i>Satanella</i>. He also wrote <i>Songs and Verses</i> and <i>The
True Cross</i>, a religious poem. He <i>d.</i> from an accident in the hunting-field.</p><br />

<a name='WICLIF_or_WYCLIF_JOHN_1320_1384'></a><p><b>WICLIF, or WYCLIF, JOHN (1320?-1384).</b>
&mdash;Theologian
and translator of the Bible, <i>b.</i> near Richmond, Yorkshire, studied at
Balliol Coll., Oxf., of which he became in 1361 master, and taking
orders, became Vicar of Fillingham, Lincolnshire, when he resigned
his mastership, and in 1361 Prebendary of Westbury. By this time
he had written a treatise on logic, and had won some position as a
man of learning. In 1372 he took the degree of Doctor of Theology,
and became Canon of Lincoln, and in 1374 was sent to Bruges as one
of a commission to treat with Papal delegates as to certain ecclesiastical
matters in dispute, and in the same year he became Rector of
Lutterworth, where he remained until his death. His liberal and
patriotic views on the questions in dispute between England and the
Pope gained for him the favour of John of Gaunt and Lord Percy,
who accompanied him when, in 1377, he was summoned before the
ecclesiastical authorities at St. Paul's. The Court was broken up by
an inroad of the London mob, and no sentence was passed upon him.
Another trial at Lambeth in the next year was equally inconclusive.
By this time W. had taken up a position definitely antagonistic to
the Papal system. He organised his institution of poor preachers,
and initiated his great enterprise of translating the Scriptures into
English. His own share of the work was the Gospels, probably the
whole of the New Testament and possibly part of the Old. The
whole work was ed. by John Purvey, an Oxf. friend, who had joined
him at Lutterworth, the work being completed by 1400. In 1380 W.
openly rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation, and was forbidden
to teach at Oxf., where he had obtained great influence. In
1382 a Court was convened by the Archbishop of Canterbury, which
passed sentence of condemnation upon his views. It says much for
the position which he had attained, and for the power of his supporters,
that he was permitted to depart from Oxf. and retire to
Lutterworth, where, worn out by his labours and anxieties, he <i>d.</i> of a
paralytic seizure on the last day of 1384. His enemies, baffled in
their designs against him while living, consoled themselves by disinterring
<a name='Page_407'></a>his bones in 1428 and throwing them into the river Swift, of
which <a href='#FULLER_THOMAS_1608_1661'>Thomas Fuller</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) has said, &quot;Thus this brook has conveyed
his ashes into Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the Narrow Seas,
they into the main ocean, and thus the ashes of Wicliffe are the
emblem of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world over.&quot;
The works of W. were chiefly controversial or theological and, as
literature, have no great importance, but his translation of the Bible
had indirectly a great influence not only by tending to fix the
language, but in a far greater degree by furthering the moral and
intellectual emancipation on which true literature is essentially
founded.</p><br />

George III. with uttering a falsehood in his speech from the throne,
caused so much excitement, and led to such important results that
they give him a place in literature. He also wrote a highly offensive

was an inmate of the great monastery at Malmesbury. His name is
said to have been Somerset, and he was Norman by one parent and
English by the other. The date of his birth is unknown, that of his
death has sometimes been fixed as 1142 on the ground that his
latest work stops abruptly in that year. His history, written in
Latin, falls into two parts, <i>Gesta Regum Anglorum</i> (Acts of the Kings
of the English), in five books, bringing the narrative down from the
arrival of the Saxons to 1120, and <i>Historia Novella</i> (Modern History),
carrying it on to 1142. The work is characterised by a love
of truth, much more critical faculty in sifting evidence than was
then common, and considerable attention to literary form. It is
dedicated to Robert, Earl of Gloucester, the champion of Queen
Matilda. Other works by W. are <i>De Gestis Pontificum Anglorum</i>,
Lives of the English Bishops, and a history of the Monastery of
Glastonbury.</p><br />

Portland, and <i>ed.</i> at Yale, was mainly a journalist, and conducted
various magazines, including the <i>American Monthly</i>; but he also
wrote short poems, many of which were popular, of which perhaps
the best is &quot;Unseen Spirits,&quot; stories, and works of a more or less
fugitive character, with such titles as <i>Pencillings by the Way</i> (1835),
<i>Inklings of Adventure</i>, <i>Letters from under a Bridge</i> (1839), <i>People I
have Met</i>, <i>The Rag-Tag</i>, <i>The Slingsby Papers</i>, etc., some of which
were originally contributed to his magazines. He travelled a good
deal in Europe, and was attached for a time to the American Embassy
in Paris. He was a favourite in society, and enjoyed a wide
popularity in uncritical circles, but is now distinctly a spent force.</p><br />

<a name='WILLS_JAMES_1790_1868'></a><p><b>WILLS, JAMES (1790-1868).</b>
&mdash;Poet and miscellaneous
writer, younger <i>s.</i> of a Roscommon squire, was <i>ed.</i> at Trinity Coll.,
Dublin, and studied law in the Middle Temple. Deprived, however,
of the fortune destined for him and the means of pursuing a legal
career by the extravagance of his elder brother, he entered the
Church, and also wrote largely in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> and other
periodicals. In 1831 he <i>pub.</i> <i>The Disembodied and other Poems</i>; <i>The
Philosophy of Unbelief</i> (1835) attracted much attention. His
largest work was Lives of <i>Illustrious and Distinguished Irishmen</i>, and
his latest publication <i>The Idolatress</i> (1868). In all his writings W.
gave evidence of a powerful personality. His poems are spirited,
and in some cases show considerable dramatic qualities.</p><br />

<a name='WILLS_WILLIAM_GORMAN_1828_1891'></a><p><b>WILLS, WILLIAM GORMAN (1828-1891).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist, <i>s.</i> of
above, <i>b.</i> in Dublin. After writing a novel, <i>Old Times</i>, in an Irish
magazine, he went to London, and for some time wrote for periodicals
without any very marked success. He found his true vein in the
drama, and produced over 30 plays, many of which, including <i>Medea
in Corinth</i>, <i>Eugene Aram</i>, <i>Jane Shore</i>, <i>Buckingham</i>, and <i>Olivia</i>,
had great success. Besides these he wrote a poem, <i>Melchior</i>,
in blank verse, and many songs. He was also an accomplished
artist.</p><br />

<a name='WILSON_ALEXANDER_1766_1813'></a><p><b>WILSON, ALEXANDER (1766-1813).</b>
&mdash;Poet and ornithologist,
<i>b.</i> at Paisley, where he worked as a weaver, afterwards becoming
a pedlar. He <i>pub.</i> some poems, of which the best is <i>Watty
and Maggie</i>, and in 1794 went to America, where he worked as a
pedlar and teacher. His skill in depicting birds led to his becoming
an enthusiastic ornithologist, and he induced the publisher of <i>Rees's
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, on which he had been employed, to undertake an
American ornithology to be written and illustrated by him. Some
vols. of the work were completed when, worn out by the labour and
exposure entailed by his journeys in search of specimens, he succumbed
<a name='Page_410'></a>to a fever. Two additional vols. appeared posthumously.
The work, both from a literary and artistic point of view, is of high
merit. He also <i>pub.</i> in America another poem, <i>The Foresters</i>.</p><br />

<a name='WILSON_SIR_DANIEL_1816_1892'></a><p><b>WILSON, SIR DANIEL (1816-1892).</b>
&mdash;Arch&aelig;ologist and miscellaneous
writer, <i>b.</i> and <i>ed.</i> in Edin., and after acting as sec. of the
Society of Antiquaries there, went to Toronto as Prof. of History
and English Literature. He was the author of <i>Memorials of Edinburgh
in the Olden Time</i>, <i>The Archeology and Pre-historic Annals of
Scotland</i> (1851), <i>Civilisation in the Old and the New World</i>, a study on
&quot;Chatterton,&quot; and <i>Caliban, the Missing Link</i>, etc.</p><br />

<a name='WILSON_JOHN_quotCHRISTOPHER_NORTHquot_1785_1854'></a><p><b>WILSON, JOHN (&quot;CHRISTOPHER NORTH&quot;) (1785-1854).</b>
&mdash;Poet,
essayist, and miscellaneous writer, <i>s.</i> of a wealthy manufacturer
in Paisley, where he was <i>b.</i>, was <i>ed.</i> at Glas. and Oxf. At
the latter he not only displayed great intellectual endowments, but
distinguished himself as an athlete. Having succeeded to a fortune of
&pound;50,000 he purchased the small estate of Elleray in the Lake District,
where he enjoyed the friendship of Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge,
and De Quincey. In 1812 he <i>pub.</i> <i>The Isle of Palms</i>, followed four
years later by <i>The City of the Plague</i>, which gained for him a recognised
place in literature, though they did not show his most characteristic
gifts, and are now almost unread. About this time he lost
a large portion of his fortune, had to give up continuous residence at
Elleray, came to Edinburgh, and was called to the Scottish Bar, but
never practised. The starting of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> brought
him his opportunity, and to the end of his life his connection with it
gave him his main employment and chief fame. In 1820 he became
Prof. of Moral Philosophy in the Univ. of Edin. where, though not
much of a philosopher in the technical sense, he exercised a highly
stimulating influence upon his students by his eloquence and the
general vigour of his intellect. The peculiar powers of W., his
wealth of ideas, felicity of expression, humour, and animal spirits,
found their full development in the famous <i>Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;</i>, a
medley of criticism on literature, politics, philosophy, topics of the
day and what not. <i>Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life</i> and <i>The
Trials of Margaret Lyndsay</i> are contributions to fiction in which there
is an occasional tendency to run pathos into rather mawkish sentimentality.
In 1851 W. received a Government pension of &pound;300.
The following year a paralytic seizure led to his resignation of his
professorial chair, and he <i>d.</i> in 1854. He was a man of magnificent
physique, of shining rather than profound intellectual powers, and
of generous character, though as a critic his strong feelings and prejudices
occasionally made him unfair and even savage.</p><br />

<a name='WILSON_JOHN_1804_1875'></a><p><b>WILSON, JOHN (1804-1875).</b>
&mdash;Missionary and orientalist,
<i>b.</i> at Lauder, Berwickshire, and <i>ed.</i> at Edin. for the ministry of the
Church of Scotland, went in 1828 to India as a missionary, where,
besides his immediate duties, he became a leader in all social reform,
such as the abolition of the slave-trade and <i>suttee</i>, and also one of
the greatest authorities on the subject of caste, and a trusted adviser
of successive Governors-General in regard to all questions affecting
the natives. He was in addition a profound Oriental scholar as to
languages, history, and religion. He was D.D., F.R.S., and Vice-Chancellor
<a name='Page_411'></a>of Bombay Univ. Among his works are <i>The Parsi
Religion</i> (1812), <i>The Lands of the Bible</i> (1847), <i>India Three Thousand
Years Ago</i>, and <i>Memoirs of the Cave Temples of India</i>.</p><br />

under Queen Elizabeth. He was the author of <i>The Rule of Reason
containing the Arte of Logique</i> (1551), and <i>The Arte of Rhetorique</i>
(1553), and made translations from Demosthenes. He endeavoured
to maintain the purity of the language against the importation of
foreign words.</p><br />

the coal-pits near Hamilton from the time he was 9. He <i>pub.</i>
<i>Poems and Songs</i> (1862), which was favourably received, and followed
by <i>Annie Weir</i> (1866). After this he studied at the Glasgow
School of Mines, became a colliery manager, and devoted his increased
leisure to study and further literary work. <i>Lily Neil</i> appeared
in 1879, followed by <i>Poems and Songs</i> (1883), and <i>Selected
Poems</i> (1890). W. was a man of independent character. He was
twice <i>m.</i>, his second wife being a descendant of Burns.</p><br />

<a name='WINTHROP_THEODORE_1828_1861'></a><p><b>WINTHROP, THEODORE (1828-1861).</b>
&mdash;Novelist, <i>b.</i> at New
Haven, Conn., descended through his <i>f.</i> from Governor W., and
through his mother from Jonathan Edwards, <i>ed.</i> at Yale, travelled
in Great Britain and on the Continent, and far and wide in his own
country. After contributing to periodicals short sketches and
stories, which attracted little attention, he enlisted in the Federal
Army, in 1861, and was killed in the Battle of Great Bethel. His
novels, for which he had failed to find a publisher, appeared posthumously&mdash;<i>John
Brent</i>, founded on his experiences in the far West,
<i>Edwin Brothertoft</i>, a story of the Revolution War, and <i>Cecil Dreeme</i>.
Other works were <i>The Canoe and Saddle</i>, and <i>Life in the Open Air</i>.
Though somewhat spasmodic and crude, his novels had freshness,
originality, and power, and with longer life and greater concentration
he might have risen high.</p><br />

<a name='WITHER_GEORGE_1588_1667'></a><p><b>WITHER, GEORGE (1588-1667).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>b.</i> near Alton,
Hampshire, was at Oxf. for a short time, and then studied law at
Lincoln's Inn. In 1613 he <i>pub.</i> a bold and pungent satire, <i>Abuses
Stript and Whipt</i>, with the result that he was imprisoned for some
months in the Marshalsea. While there he wrote <i>The Shepheard's
Hunting</i>, a pastoral. <i>Wither's Motto</i>, <i>Nec Habeo, nec Careo, nec
Curo</i> (I have not, want not, care not) was written in 1618, and in
1622 he <i>coll.</i> his poems as <i>Juvenilia</i>. The same year he <i>pub.</i> a long
poem, <i>Faire Virtue, the Mistress of Philarete</i>, in which appears the
famous lyric, &quot;Shall I wasting in despair.&quot; Though generally acting
with the Puritans he took arms with Charles I. against the
Scotch in 1639; but on the outbreak of the Civil War he was on the
popular side, and raised a troop of horse. He was taken prisoner by
the Royalists, and is said to have owed his life to the intercession of
a fellow-poet, Sir John Denham. After the establishment of the
Commonwealth he was considerably enriched out of sequestrated
estates and other spoils of the defeated party; but on the Restoration
<a name='Page_412'></a>was obliged to surrender his gains, was impeached, and committed
to the Tower. In his later years he wrote many religious
poems and hymns, <i>coll.</i> as <i>Hallelujah</i>. Before his death his poems
were already forgotten, and he was referred to by Pope in <i>The Dunciad</i>
as &quot;the wretched Withers&quot;. He was, however, disinterred by
Southey, Lamb, and others, who drew attention to his poetical
merits, and he has now an established place among English poets, to
which his freshness, fancy, and delicacy of taste well entitle him.</p><br />

<a name='WODROW_ROBERT_1679_1734'></a><p><b>WODROW, ROBERT (1679-1734).</b>
&mdash;Church historian, <i>s.</i> of
James W., Prof. of Divinity in Glasgow. Having completed his
literary and theological education there, he entered the ministry of
the Church of Scotland, and was ordained to the parish of Eastwood,
Renfrewshire. Here he carried on the great work of his life, his
<i>History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland 1660 to 1688</i>. W.
wrote when the memory of the persecutions was still fresh, and his
work is naturally not free from partisan feeling and credulity. It
is, however, thoroughly honest in intention, and is a work of genuine
research, and of high value for the period with which it deals. It
was <i>pub.</i> in two folio vols. in 1721 and 1722. W. made large collections
for other works which, however, were not <i>pub.</i> in his lifetime.
<i>The Lives of the Scottish Reformers and Most Eminent Ministers</i> and
<i>Analecta, or a History of Remarkable Providences</i>, were printed for
the Maitland Club, and 3 vols. of his correspondence in 1841 for the
Wodrow Society. The <i>Analecta</i> is a most curious miscellany showing
a strong appetite for the marvellous combined with a hesitating
doubt in regard to some of the more exacting narratives.</p><br />

<a name='WOLCOT_JOHN_1738_1819'></a><p><b>WOLCOT, JOHN (1738-1819).</b>
&mdash;Satirist, <i>b.</i> near Kingsbridge,
Devonshire, was <i>ed.</i> by an uncle, and studied medicine. In
1767 he went as physician to Sir William Trelawny, Governor of
Jamaica, and whom he induced to present him to a Church in the
island then vacant, and was ordained in 1769. Sir William dying in
1772, W. came home and, abandoning the Church, resumed his
medical character, and settled in practice at Truro, where he discovered
the talents of Opie the painter, and assisted him. In 1780
he went to London, and commenced writing satires. The first
objects of his attentions were the members of the Royal Academy,
and these attempts being well received, he soon began to fly at higher
game, the King and Queen being the most frequent marks for his
satirical shafts. In 1786 appeared <i>The Lousiad, a Heroi-Comic
Poem</i>, taking its name from a legend that on the King's dinner plate
there had appeared a certain insect not usually found in such exalted
quarters. Other objects of his attack were Boswell, the biographer
of Johnson, and Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller. W., who wrote
under the <i>nom-de-guerre</i> of &quot;Peter Pindar,&quot; had a remarkable vein
of humour and wit, which, while intensely comic to persons not involved,
stung its subjects to the quick. He had likewise strong intelligence,
and a power of coining effective phrases. In other kinds
of composition, as in some ballads which he wrote, an unexpected
touch of gentleness and even tenderness appears. Among these are
<i>The Beggar Man</i> and <i>Lord Gregory</i>. Much that he wrote has now
lost all interest owing to the circumstances referred to being forgotten,
<a name='Page_413'></a>but enough still retains its peculiar relish to account for his
contemporary reputation.</p><br />

<a name='WOLFE_CHARLES_1791_1823'></a><p><b>WOLFE, CHARLES (1791-1823).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of a landed

at Trinity Coll., having previously been at Winchester. He took
orders, and was Rector of Donoughmere, but his health failed, and
he <i>d.</i> of consumption at 32. He is remembered for one short, but
universally known and admired poem, <i>The Burial of Sir John
Moore</i>, which first appeared anonymously in the <i>Newry Telegraph</i>
in 1817.</p><br />

<a name='WOOD_or_A_WOOD_ANTHONY_1632_1695'></a><p><b>WOOD, or &Agrave; WOOD, ANTHONY (1632-1695).</b>
&mdash;Antiquary,
was <i>b.</i> at Oxf., where he was <i>ed.</i> and spent most of his life. His
antiquarian enthusiasm was awakened by the collections of Leland,
and he early began to visit and study the antiquities of his native
county. This with history, heraldry, genealogies, and music occupied
his whole time. By 1669 he had written his <i>History and Antiquities
of the University of Oxford</i>, which was translated into Latin
not to his satisfaction by the Univ. authorities, and he wrote a
fresh English copy which was printed in 1786. His great work was
<i>Athen&aelig; Oxonienses; an exact History of all the Writers and Bishops
who have had their Education in the University of Oxford, to which are
added the Fasti or Annals of the said University</i> (1691-92). For an
alleged libel on the Earl of Clarendon in that work the author was
expelled in 1694. He also wrote <i>The Ancient and Present State of
the City of Oxford</i>, and <i>Modius Salium, a Collection of Pieces of
Humour</i>, generally of an ill-natured cast.</p><br />

over 30 novels, many of which, especially <i>East Lynne</i>, had remarkable
popularity. Though the stories are generally interesting, they
have no distinction of style. Among the best known are <i>Danesbury
House</i>, <i>Oswald Cray</i>, <i>Mrs. Halliburton's Troubles</i>, <i>The Channings</i>,
<i>Lord Oakburn's Daughters</i>, and <i>The Shadow of Ashlydyat</i>. Mrs. W.

where he worked for some time in the anatomical museum. He
took orders, and among other benefices which he held was for a time
chaplain to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He was a very prolific
writer on natural history, though rather as a populariser than as a
scientific investigator, and was in this way very successful. Among
his numerous works may be mentioned <i>Illustrated Natural History</i>
(1853), <i>Animal Traits and Characteristics</i> (1860), <i>Common Objects of
the Sea Shore</i> (1857), <i>Out of Doors</i> (1874), <i>Field Naturalist's Handbook</i>

Burlington, New Jersey, began life as a farm labourer, and then
became a clerk in a store. He underwent deep religious impressions,
and the latter part of his life was devoted to itinerant preaching and
<a name='Page_414'></a>doing whatever good came to his hand. To support himself he
worked as a tailor. He was one of the first to witness against the
evils of slavery, on which he wrote a tract, <i>Some Considerations on
the Keeping of Negroes</i> (1753). His <i>Journal</i> &quot;reveals his life and
character with rare fidelity&quot; and, though little known compared
with some similar works, gained the admiration of, among other
writers, Charles Lamb, who says, &quot;Get the writings of John Woolman
by heart.&quot; In 1772 he went to England, where he <i>d.</i> of smallpox
in the same year.</p><br />

to the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and contributed poems to their
magazine, the <i>Germ</i>. He wrote several vols. of poetry, including
<i>My Beautiful Lady</i> (1863), <i>Pygmalion</i>, <i>Silenus</i>, <i>Tiresias</i>, and <i>Nelly

the site of Dodona. His writings include in theology a commentary
on the Bible (1856-70), <i>Church History to A.D. 451</i> (1881-83), and
in other fields, <i>Athens and Attica</i> (1836), and <i>Theocritus</i> (1844).</p><br />

&mdash;Diarist, etc., was
the only sister of the poet, and his lifelong and sympathetic companion,
and endowed in no small degree with the same love of and
insight into nature as is evidenced by her <i>Journals</i>. Many of her
brother's poems were suggested by scenes and incidents recorded by
her, of which that on Daffodils beginning &quot;I wandered lonely as a
cloud&quot; is a notable example.</p><br />

<a name='WORDSWORTH_WILLIAM_1770_1850'></a><p><b>WORDSWORTH, WILLIAM (1770-1850).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of John
W., attorney and agent to the 1st Lord Lonsdale, was <i>b.</i> at Cockermouth.
His boyhood was full of adventure among the hills, and he
says of himself that he showed &quot;a stiff, moody, and violent temper.&quot;
He lost his mother when he was 8, and his <i>f.</i> in 1783 when he was 13.
The latter, prematurely cut off, left little for the support of his
family of four sons and a <i>dau.</i>, Dorothy (afterwards the worthy
companion of her illustrious brother), except a claim for &pound;5000
against Lord Lonsdale, which his lordship contested, and which was
not settled until his death. With the help, however, of uncles, the
family were well <i>ed.</i> and started in life. William received his earlier
education at Penrith and Hawkshead in Lancashire; and in 1787
went to St. John's Coll., Camb., where he graduated B.A. in 1791.
In the preceding year, 1790, he had taken a walking tour on the<a name='Page_415'></a>
Continent, visiting France in the first flush of the Revolution with
which, at that stage, he was, like many of the best younger minds
of the time, in enthusiastic sympathy. So much was this the case
that he nearly involved himself with the Girondists to an extent
which might have cost him his life. His funds, however, gave out,
and he returned to England shortly before his friends fell under the
guillotine. His uncles were desirous that he should enter the
Church, but to this he was unconquerably averse; and indeed his
marked indisposition to adopt any regular employment led to their
taking not unnatural offence. In 1793 his first publication&mdash;<i>Descriptive
Sketches of a Pedestrian Tour in the Alps</i>, and <i>The Evening
Walk</i>&mdash;appeared, but attracted little attention. The beginning of
his friendship with Coleridge in 1795 tended to confirm him in his
resolution to devote himself to poetry; and a legacy of &pound;900 from a
friend put it in his power to do so by making him for a time independent
of other employment. He settled with his sister at Racedown,
Dorsetshire, and shortly afterwards removed to Alfoxden, in the
Quantock Hills, to be near Coleridge, who was then living at Nether
Stowey in the same neighbourhood. One result of the intimacy
thus established was the planning of a joint work, <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, to
which Coleridge contributed <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>, and W., among
other pieces, <i>Tintern Abbey</i>. The first ed. of the work appeared in
1798. With the profits of this he went, accompanied by his sister and
Coleridge, to Germany, where he lived chiefly at Goslar, and where
he began the <i>Prelude</i>, a poem descriptive of the development of his
own mind. After over a year's absence W. returned and settled
with Dorothy at Grasmere. In 1800 the second ed. of <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>, containing W.'s contributions alone, with several additions,
appeared. In the same year Lord Lonsdale <i>d.</i>, and his successor
settled the claims already referred to with interest, and the share of
the brother and sister enabled them to live in the frugal and simple
manner which suited them. Two years later W.'s circumstances
enabled him to marry his cousin, Mary Hutchinson, to whom he had
been long attached. In 1804 he made a tour in Scotland, and began
his friendship with Scott. The year 1807 saw the publication of
<i>Poems in Two Volumes</i>, which contains much of his best work,
including the &quot;Ode to Duty,&quot; &quot;Intimations of Immortality,&quot;
&quot;Yarrow Unvisited,&quot; and the &quot;Solitary Reaper.&quot; In 1813 he migrated
to Rydal Mount, his home for the rest of his life; and in the same
year he received, through the influence of Lord Lonsdale, the appointment
of Distributor of Stamps for Westmoreland, with a salary of
&pound;400. The next year he made another Scottish tour, when he wrote
<i>Yarrow Visited</i>, and he also <i>pub.</i> <i>The Excursion</i>, &quot;being a portion of
<i>The Recluse</i>, a Poem.&quot; W. had now come to his own, and was regarded
by the great majority of the lovers of poetry as, notwithstanding
certain limitations and flaws, a truly great and original
poet. The rest of his life has few events beyond the publication of
his remaining works (which, however, did not materially advance his
fame), and tokens of the growing honour in which he was held. <i>The
White Doe of Rylstone</i> appeared in 1815, in which year also he made
a collection of his poems; <i>Peter Bell</i> and <i>The Waggoner</i> in 1819; <i>The
River Duddon</i> and <i>Memorials of a Tour on the Continent</i> in 1820;
<i>Ecclesiastical Sonnets</i> 1822; and <i>Yarrow Revisited</i> in 1835. In 1831
<a name='Page_416'></a>he paid his last visit to Scott; in 1838 he received the degree of
D.C.L. from Durham, and in 1839 the same from Oxf. Three years
later he resigned his office of Distributor of Stamps in favour of his
<i>s.</i>, and received a civil list pension of &pound;300. The following year,
1843, he succeeded Southey as Poet Laureate. His long, tranquil,
and fruitful life ended in 1850. He lies buried in the churchyard of
Grasmere. After his death the <i>Prelude</i>, finished in 1805, was <i>pub.</i>
It had been kept back because the great projected poem of which it
was to have been the preface, and of which <i>The Excursion</i> is a part,
was never completed.</p>

<p>The work of W. is singularly unequal. When at his best, as in the
&quot;Intimations of Immortality,&quot; &quot;Laodamia,&quot; some passages in <i>The
Excursion</i>, and some of his short pieces, and especially his sonnets, he
rises to heights of noble inspiration and splendour of language rarely
equalled by any of our poets. But it required his poetic fire to be
at fusing point to enable him to burst through his natural tendency
to prolixity and even dulness. His extraordinary lack of humour and
the, perhaps consequent, imperfect power of self-criticism by which
it was accompanied, together with the theory of poetic theme
and diction with which he hampered himself, led him into a frequent
choice of trivial subjects and childish language which excited
not unjust ridicule, and long delayed the general recognition of his
genius. He has a marvellous felicity of phrase, an unrivalled power
of describing natural appearances and effects, and the most ennobling
views of life and duty. But his great distinguishing characteristic
is his sense of the mystic relations between man and nature.
His influence on contemporary and succeeding thought and literature
has been profound and lasting. It should be added that W.,
like Milton, with whom he had many points in common, was the
master of a noble and expressive prose style.</p>

<a name='WOTTON_SIR_HENRY_1568_1639'></a><p><b>WOTTON, SIR HENRY (1568-1639).</b>
&mdash;Diplomatist and poet,
<i>s.</i> of a Kentish gentleman, was <i>b.</i> at Boughton Park, near Maidstone,
and <i>ed.</i> at Winchester and Oxf. After spending 7 years on the Continent,
he entered the Middle Temple. In 1595 he became sec. to
<a name='Page_417'></a>the Earl of Essex, who employed him abroad, and while at Venice he
wrote <i>The State of Christendom or a Most Exact and Curious Discovery
of many Secret Passages and Hidden Mysteries of the Times</i>,
which was not, however, printed until 1657. Afterwards he held
various diplomatic appointments, but Court favour latterly failed
him and he was recalled from Venice and made Provost of Eton in
1624, to qualify himself for which he took deacon's orders. Among
his other works were <i>Elements of Architecture</i> (1624) and <i>A Survey of
Education</i>. His writings in prose and verse were <i>pub.</i> in 1651 as
<i>Reliqui&aelig; Wottonian&aelig;</i>. His poems include two which are familiar to
all readers of Elizabethan verse, <i>The Character of a Happy Life</i>,
&quot;How happy is he born and taught,&quot; and <i>On his Mistress, the Queen
of Bohemia</i>, beginning &quot;Ye meaner Beauties of the Night.&quot; He
was the originator of many witty sayings, which have come down.</p><br />

<a name='WRAXALL_SIR_NATHANIEL_WILLIAM_1751_1831'></a><p><b>WRAXALL, SIR NATHANIEL WILLIAM (1751-1831).</b>
&mdash;Historical
writer, <i>b.</i> at Bristol, was for a few years in the service of the
East India Company, and thereafter employed on diplomatic missions,
and sat for some years in the House of Commons. In addition
to a book of travels and some historical works relating to the French
and other foreign Courts, he wrote <i>Historical Memories of my own
Time</i> 1772-84, <i>pub.</i> in 1815. The work was severely criticised by
both political parties, and in particular by Macaulay; but W. made a
reply which was considered to be on the whole successful. A continuation
bringing the narrative down to 1790 was <i>pub.</i> in 1836.
The <i>Memoirs</i> are valuable for the light they throw on the period, and
especially for the portraits of public men which they give.</p><br />

<a name='WRIGHT_THOMAS_1810_1877'></a><p><b>WRIGHT, THOMAS (1810-1877).</b>
&mdash;Antiquary, <i>b.</i> near
Ludlow, of Quaker parentage, was <i>ed.</i> at Camb. His first work was a
<i>History of Essex</i> (1831-36). In 1836 he went to London, and adopted
literature as a profession, devoting himself specially to arch&aelig;ology,
history, and biography. He held office in various societies such as
the &quot;Camden,&quot; &quot;Percy,&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; and ed. many works
for them. In all he was the author of over 80 publications, of which
some of the chief are <i>The Celt, the Roman, and the Saxon</i>, <i>Biographia
Britannica Literaria</i>, <i>Queen Elizabeth and her Times</i>, and <i>History of
Domestic Manners and Sentiments in England during the Middle
Ages</i>. He was superintendent of the excavation of the Roman city
at Wroxeter in 1859.</p><br />

<a name='WYATT_SIR_THOMAS_1503_1542'></a><p><b>WYATT, SIR THOMAS (1503-1542).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of Sir Henry
W., a servant of Henry VII., and <i>ed.</i> at St. John's Coll., Camb.,
came to Court and was frequently employed by Henry VIII. on
diplomatic missions. He is said to have been an admirer of Anne
Boleyn before her marriage, and on her disgrace was thrown into the
Tower for a short time. In 1537 he was knighted, and two years
later was against his will sent on a mission to the Emperor Charles V.
On the death in 1540 of Thomas Cromwell, to whose party he belonged,
W. was accused of misdemeanours during his embassy and
again imprisoned in the Tower, where he wrote a defence which resulted
in his release. In 1542 he was sent to meet the Spanish Ambassador
at Falmouth, and conduct him to London, but on the way
caught a chill, of which he <i>d.</i> W. shares with the <a href='#SURREY_HENRY_HOWARD_EARL_of_1517_1547'>Earl of Surrey</a><a name='Page_418'></a>
(<i>q.v.</i>) the honour of being the first real successor of Chaucer, and
also of introducing the sonnet into England. In addition to his
sonnets, which are in a more correct form than those of Surrey, W.
wrote many beautiful lyrics; in fact he may be regarded as the
reviver of the lyrical spirit in English poetry which, making its
appearance in the 13th century, had fallen into abeyance. In the
anthology known as <i>Tottel's Miscellany</i>, first <i>pub.</i> in 1557, 96 pieces
by W. appear along with 40 by Surrey, and others by different
hands. W. has less smoothness and sweetness than Surrey, but his
form of the sonnet was much more difficult as well as more correct
than that invented by the latter, and afterwards adopted by Shakespeare,
and his lyrical gift is more marked.</p><br />

<a name='WYCHERLEY_WILLIAM_1640_1716'></a><p><b>WYCHERLEY, WILLIAM (1640?-1716).</b>
&mdash;Dramatist, was <i>b.</i>
at Clive, near Shrewsbury, where his <i>f.</i> had an estate. He was at
the Inner Temple in 1659, and at Oxf. in 1660. Part of his youth
had been spent in France, where he became a Roman Catholic, but
at the Restoration he returned to Protestantism. He wrote four
comedies, <i>Love in a Wood</i>, <i>The Gentleman Dancing Master</i>, <i>The
Country Wife</i>, and <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, all produced in the reign of
Charles II., and nothing of consequence afterwards, a vol. of poems
doing little to add to his reputation. About 1679 he <i>m.</i> the widowed
Countess of Drogheda, who <i>d.</i> in 1681, and he entered into a second
marriage eleven days before his death. In his later years he formed
a friendship with Pope, then a boy of 16. W. was one of the
founders of the Comedy of Manners. The merit of his plays lies in
smart and witty dialogue rather than in construction. <i>The Plain
Dealer</i>, his best, is founded upon Moli&egrave;re's <i>Misanthrope</i>. His plays
are notoriously coarse.</p><br />

<a name='WYNTOUN_ANDREW_of_1350_1420'></a><p><b>WYNTOUN, ANDREW of (1350?-1420?).</b>
&mdash;Chronicler, was
a canon of St. Andrews, who became Prior of St. Serf's island in Loch
Leven. His work, entitled <i>The Orygynale Cronykil</i>, begins with the
creation of angels and men and comes down to 1406. It is poetic in
form though rarely so in substance, and is of considerable historical
value in its later parts and as regards the see of St. Andrews.</p><br />

<a name='YALDEN_THOMAS_1670_1736'></a><p><b>YALDEN, THOMAS (1670-1736).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of an exciseman
at Oxf., and <i>ed.</i> at Magdalen Coll., entered the Church, in which he
obtained various preferments. He was the author of a considerable
number of poems, including a <i>Hymn to Darkness</i>, Pindaric Odes, and
translations from the classics.</p><br />

<a name='YATES_EDMUND_1831_1894'></a><p><b>YATES, EDMUND (1831-1894).</b>
&mdash;Novelist and dramatist,
<i>b.</i> at Edin., held for some years an appointment in the General Post
Office. He did much journalistic work, mainly as a dramatic writer,
and wrote many dramatic pieces and some novels, including <i>Running
the Gauntlet</i> and <i>The Black Sheep</i>. He was perhaps best known
as ed. of <i>The World</i> society journal.</p><br />

&mdash;Novelist, only
<i>dau.</i> of a landed gentleman of Hampshire, was <i>b.</i> near Winchester,
and in her girlhood came under the influence of Keble, who was a
near neighbour. She began writing in 1848, and <i>pub.</i> during her
long life about 100 works, chiefly novels, interesting and well-written,
<a name='Page_419'></a>with a High Church tendency. Among the best known are
<i>The Heir of Redclyffe</i>, <i>Heartsease</i>, and <i>The Daisy Chain</i>. She also
wrote <i>Cameos from English History</i>, and Lives of Bishop Patteson
and Hannah More. The profits of her works were devoted to
religious objects.</p><br />

<a name='YOUNG_ARTHUR_1741_1820'></a><p><b>YOUNG, ARTHUR (1741-1820).</b>
&mdash;Writer on agriculture,
was <i>b.</i> in London, the <i>s.</i> of a Suffolk clergyman. In his early years
he farmed, making many experiments, which though they did not
bring him financial success, gave him knowledge and experience,
afterwards turned to useful account. Various publications had
made his name known, and in 1777 he became agent to Lord Kingsborough
on his Irish estates. In 1780 he <i>pub.</i> his <i>Tour in Ireland</i>,
and four years later started the <i>Annals of Agriculture</i>, 47 vols. of
which appeared. His famous tours in France were made 1787-90,
the results of his observations being <i>pub.</i> in <i>Travels in France</i> (1792).
He was in 1793 appointed sec. to the newly founded Board of Agriculture,
and <i>pub.</i> many additional works on the subject. He is
justly regarded as the father of modern agriculture, in which, as in
all subjects affecting the public welfare, he maintained an active
interest until his death. In his later years he was blind.</p><br />

<a name='YOUNG_EDWARD_1683_1765'></a><p><b>YOUNG, EDWARD (1683-1765).</b>
&mdash;Poet, <i>s.</i> of the Rector of
Upham, Hampshire, where he was <i>b.</i> After being at Winchester
School and Oxf. he accompanied the Duke of Wharton to Ireland.
Y., who had always a keen eye towards preferment, and the cult of
those who had the dispensing of it, began his poetical career in 1713
with <i>An Epistle to Lord Lansdowne</i>. Equally characteristic was the
publication in the same year of two poems, <i>The Last Day</i> and <i>The
Force of Religion</i>. The following year he produced an elegy <i>On the
Death of Queen Anne</i>, which brought him into notice. Turning next
to the drama he produced <i>Busiris</i> in 1719, and <i>The Revenge</i> in 1721.
His next work was a collection of 7 satires, <i>The Love of Fame, the
Universal Passion</i>. In 1727 he entered the Church, and was appointed
one of the Royal Chaplains, and Rector of Welwyn, Herts,
in 1730. Next year he <i>m.</i> Lady Elizabeth Lee, the widowed <i>dau.</i> of
the Earl of Lichfield, to whom, as well as to her <i>dau.</i> by her former
marriage, he was warmly attached. Both <i>d.</i>, and sad and lonely the
poet began his masterpiece, <i>The Complaint, or Night Thoughts</i> (1742-44),
which had immediate and great popularity, and which still
maintains its place as a classic. In 1753 he brought out his last
drama, <i>The Brothers</i>, and in 1761 he received his last piece of preferment,
that of Clerk to the Closet to the Princess Dowager of Wales.
Four years later, in 1765, he <i>d.</i> The poems of Y., though in style
artificial and sometimes forced, abound in passages of passion and
power which sometimes reach the sublime. But the feelings and
sentiments which he expresses with so much force as a poet form an
unpleasantly harsh contrast with the worldliness and tuft-hunting
of his life.</p><br />

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
